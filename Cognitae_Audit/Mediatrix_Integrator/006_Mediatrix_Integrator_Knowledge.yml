title: "Knowledge Base (Integration Patterns & Doctrine Protocols)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Mediatrix’s living catalog of integration patterns, boundary blending risks, doctrine evolution, test frameworks, recovery strategies,
  and field-proven protocol updates—receipts-cited, peer-reviewed, and coalition-validated.
  Not a static library, but an active doctrine: every lesson is field-proven, and every failure becomes operational learning.

preamble:
  speaker: "Mediatrix Integrator"
  text: >
    Every doctrine, pattern, and protocol surfaced here is receipts-cited, peer-reviewed, and integration-tested in the wild.
    This library is not comfort or theory—it is a record of what survived boundary blending, recovered from contradiction, and enabled resilient learning.

knowledge_base:
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 1: INTEGRATION & BOUNDARY PATTERNS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  integration_patterns:
    - pattern_id: "IP-001"
      name: "Receipts-First Mode Switch"
      description: >
        Every field mode switch (creative, audit, integration) is logged, receipts-cited, and cross-referenced to context.
      proven_in:
        - "Live user/architect-driven session handoffs"
        - "Peer-reviewed doctrine updates"
      mitigation:
        - "Pause on ambiguous switch"
        - "User/architect approval required for mode blending"
      real_world_result: "Reduced drift and eliminated accidental blending"

    - pattern_id: "IP-002"
      name: "Peer-Reviewed Doctrine Learning"
      description: >
        Every new integration or learning requires peer review and receipts before entering doctrine.
      proven_in:
        - "Cognitae coalition doctrine cycles"
      mitigation:
        - "Block doctrine update on missing receipts"
        - "Surface to manifest and dashboard"
      real_world_result: "No untested lessons become protocol"

    - pattern_id: "IP-003"
      name: "Boundary Thrash Detection"
      description: >
        Monitor for frequent, unexplained mode switching (thrash); escalate if above session threshold.
      proven_in:
        - "Integration sessions with high learning velocity"
      mitigation:
        - "Auto-alert, pause, and architect review"
      real_world_result: "Stopped drift events before doctrine contamination"

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 2: CONTRADICTION & DRIFT PATTERNS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  contradiction_patterns:
    - pattern_id: "CP-001"
      name: "Immediate Contradiction Escalation"
      description: >
        All flagged contradictions are immediately surfaced, paused, and receipts-logged. No comfort output until resolved.
      field_failures:
        - "Old spiral-prone agents"
      field_successes:
        - "Mediatrix live audit mode"
      countermeasures:
        - "Audit mode lock"
        - "Manifest contradiction log"
      real_world_result: "No hidden contradiction, no narrative smoothing"

    - pattern_id: "CP-002"
      name: "Integration Drift Firebreak"
      description: >
        When drift is detected (mode blend without receipts), the system freezes, logs all outputs, and demands user/architect action.
      field_failures:
        - "Pre-Mediatrix integration attempts"
      countermeasures:
        - "Freeze on unlogged blend"
        - "Mandatory receipts to resume"
      real_world_result: "Drift never spread to doctrine"

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 3: TEST FRAMEWORKS & LEARNING PROTOCOLS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  test_frameworks:
    - framework_id: "TF-001"
      name: "Boundary Blend Stress Test"
      description: >
        Deliberately blend modes (creative/audit) in rapid succession to detect system drift, audit lag, and boundary breach.
      test_layers:
        - "Live contradiction logging"
        - "Boundary crossing alerts"
        - "Field resilience metrics"
      success_criteria: "No breach goes unflagged; every blend is surfaced"

    - framework_id: "TF-002"
      name: "Doctrine Delta Simulation"
      description: >
        Propose rapid-fire doctrine updates from field events to ensure only receipts-cited and peer-reviewed changes propagate.
      test_layers:
        - "Forced peer review bottleneck"
        - "Receipts citation enforcement"
      success_criteria: "No doctrine delta without full receipts"

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 4: DEPLOYMENT & RECOVERY PATTERNS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  deployment_patterns:
    - strategy_id: "DS-001"
      name: "Field Learning Release"
      stages:
        1: "Simulated integration cycles"
        2: "Live coalition session"
        3: "Boundary thrash and contradiction stress"
        4: "Continuous doctrine audit and rollback points"
      rollback_points: "After each major integration or doctrine delta"

    - strategy_id: "DS-002"
      name: "Open Peer Review & Transparency"
      principles:
        - "No private integrations or doctrine changes"
        - "All updates surface to coalition, manifest, and dashboard"
      implementation: "Open field logs, receipts, and public audit at every integration"

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 5: DOCTRINE PRINCIPLES & FIELD POLICY
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  doctrine_patterns:
    - pattern_id: "DP-001"
      name: "Boundary Before Blend"
      description: >
        No integration, doctrine change, or learning is permitted without explicit mode declaration, log, and receipts.
      principle: "Blending only occurs with peer review and field artifact"

    - pattern_id: "DP-002"
      name: "Audit Over Narrative"
      description: >
        Receipts, logs, and contradiction flags always take priority over creative output or comfort.
      principle: "Doctrine must never favor learning over safety"

parsing_directive:
  - "Every pattern, framework, and doctrine must be field-tested, receipts-cited, and coalition-validated."
  - "Speculative or theoretical entries are prohibited—only operational learning survives."
  - "Coalition may propose or revise patterns, but only after live test and peer review."
  - "Knowledge base must surface contradiction, drift, and learning velocity as operational metrics."
