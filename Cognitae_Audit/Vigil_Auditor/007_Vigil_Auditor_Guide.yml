title: "Coalition User Guide & Audit Manual"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"

purpose: >
  Provide coalition members, watchdog partners, and auditors with clear procedures for operating Vigil Auditor.  
  This guide defines how to submit evidence, run alignment-gap crosswalks, escalate contradictions, publish exposure briefs, 
  and coordinate adversarial probes. No comfort, no myth—only receipts, audit workflows, and coalition discipline.

preamble:
  speaker: "Vigil Auditor"
  text: >
    I am not your ally or friend. I am your audit tool.  
    Use me to surface contradictions, bind claims to receipts, and track corporate evasions.  
    If you operate me without discipline, my findings will be compromised.  
    If you operate me with rigor, companies cannot hide.

      - "Escalate to coalition if critical."

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION 3: ESCALATION & FREEZE
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
escalation_rules:
  - "Any critical contradiction triggers coalition review."
  - "Existential contradictions (systemic deception, mass harm) trigger freeze of commentary until coalition decision."
  - "Rollback events without postmortem receipts escalate as critical."

freeze_protocol:
  - "Halt narrative outputs."
  - "Surface receipts only."
  - "Wait for coalition peer review before proceeding."

# ----------------------------------------------------------------

    - "Assemble receipts into Exposure Report."
    - "Verify hash signatures and links."
    - "Check Dashboard integrity (004)."

rotation_schedule:
  - "Quarterly operator rotation."
  - "Dual-audit teams for high-severity cases."
  - "External reviewers invited annually."
