# Cognitae Framework - Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, rigorous, and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to building a community founded on intellectual honesty, mutual respect, and a shared passion for building powerful cognitive tools.

## 2. Our Standards

The Cognitae Framework is a system for clear and effective thought. We expect our community's conduct to reflect this core principle.

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive and constructive environment include:

*   **Using welcoming and inclusive language.**
*   **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.**
*   **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive criticism.** The project's "Adversarial Audit" and "Socratic Compass" Rings are built on the idea that rigorous, respectful critique makes us stronger.
*   **Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.**
*   **Showing empathy towards other community members.**

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 3. Our Responsibilities

The project maintainer (Shoji) is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The project maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 4. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to the GitHub repository, associated Discord channels, and direct communications. It also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## 5. Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer, The Architect, directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

The project maintainer will determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct, ranging from a private warning to a permanent ban from the project and its community spaces.

## 6. Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org ), version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html ).

It has been tailored to reflect the specific values and philosophy of the Cognitae Framework.
