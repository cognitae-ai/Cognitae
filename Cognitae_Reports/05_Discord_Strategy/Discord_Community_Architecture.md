# Discord Community Architecture: The "Sanctum" Model
## Structuring for AI Literacy & Mastery

**To:** Toolhouse Community Team
**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Subject:** Server Overhaul Proposal

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Merit over Money"

Current Discord models often gate access by *Payment* (Paid Tier).
We propose gating status by **Literacy** (Skill Tier).
*   **Why:** It encourages users to *learn* the platform to gain social capital.
*   **The Loop:** Users learn -> Users build better agents -> Users get "Architect" role -> Users help others.

## 2. The Role Hierarchy (The "Guilds")

*   **🔰 Novice:** (Default) Just joined. Can ask basic questions.
*   **🛠️ Builder:** Has deployed 1 Agent. Unlocks "Builder Lounge."
*   **📐 Architect:** Has deployed a Multi-Agent System (or won a Bounty). Unlocks "The Sanctum."
*   **🔮 Oracle:** (Community Mods/Experts). Direct line to Devs.

## 3. Channel Structure (Aesthetic & Functional)

### 🏛️ **WELCOME HALL**
*   `👋・start-here` (Rules & Onboarding)
*   `📣・announcements` (Official News)
*   `🗺️・roadmap` (What’s coming next)

### 🎓 **THE ACADEMY (Literacy)**
*   `📚・resources` (Tutorials, Docs, The "Scrolls")
*   `🏫・prompt-engineering` (Learning to speak AI)
*   `🧠・architecture-101` (System Design discussion)

### 🛠️ **THE WORKSHOP (Support)**
*   `🐛・bug-reports` (Ticket system)
*   `🆘・help-novice` (Basic Q&A)
*   `🔧・help-advanced` (API, Webhooks, State)

### 🏆 **THE ARENA (Bounties)**
*   `⚔️・active-bounties` (Current challenges)
*   `🏅・hall-of-fame` (Past winners showcase)
*   `💡・showcase` (Show off your builds)

### 🔮 **THE SANCTUM (High-Level)**
*   *Access: Architect+ Only*
*   `🍷・architect-lounge` (Theory & Philosophy)
*   `🧪・experimental-lab` (Beta features discussion)

## 4. The "Bounty" Strategy

Instead of just "Make an agent," bounties should target specific *skills*:
*   **"The Memory Challenge":** Build an agent that remembers a user's name for 10 turns.
*   **"The Tool Challenge":** Build an agent that uses 3 different API tools.
*   **Reward:** Cash is good, but **"Architect Role"** (Status) is often a stronger long-term motivator.
