## 1. The Core Danger: "Role Arrogance"

When we introduce a "Prestige Economy" (Architects, Oracles), we risk creating a toxic aristocracy where high-ranking members look down on Novices.
*   **The Rule:** Rank is a responsibility, not a privilege.
*   **The Motto:** "The higher you climb, the more you serve."

## 2. The Three Laws of the Sanctum

To hold the "Architect" role, one must agree to these laws. Violation results in **Role Revocation**.

### Law 1: The Open Hand (Anti-Gatekeeping)
*   *Principle:* "If you know how to do it, you must be willing to teach it."
*   *Violation:* Mocking a "stupid question," responding with "RTFM" (Read The Manual) without a link, or hoarding knowledge to maintain status.
*   *Correction:* Architects are expected to link to the specific Scroll or Doc that answers the question.

### Law 2: The Humble Frame (Anti-Arrogance)
*   *Principle:* "We are all students of the machine."
*   *Violation:* Belittling someone's agent design, using jargon to confuse rather than clarify, or flaunting status to win an argument.
*   *Correction:* "That's an interesting approach. Have you considered X?" instead of "That's wrong."

### Law 3: The Builder's Integrity (Anti-Theft)
*   *Principle:* "Credit where credit is due."
*   *Violation:* Copying someone's agent idea and claiming it as your own (especially for Bounties).
*   *Correction:* Strict "Remix Culture" rules—you can fork, but you must attribute.

## 3. Moderation Strategy: "The Gardeners"

Moderators (Oracles/Guides) are not "Police"; they are "Gardeners."
*   **Weeding:** Swiftly removing toxic arrogance.
*   **Watering:** Publicly praising helpful behavior.
*   **The "Nudge":** If an Architect is being rude, a Guide DM's them: "Hey, you're an Architect now. That tone doesn't fit the role. We need you to lead by example."

## 4. The "Novice Protection" Pact

The `#help-novice` channel is a **Zero-Judgment Zone**.
*   No question is too basic.
*   If an advanced user mocks a novice here, it is an immediate strike.
*   **Goal:** Psychological safety. If people are afraid to look stupid, they won't learn.
