# Future Reporting Strategy
## The "Architect's Paper Trail" for Long-Term Success

**To:** The Architect
**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Subject:** Roadmap for Future Documentation

## Phase 1: The "Deal Closing" Suite (Immediate)
*Focus: Getting the contract signed and the Sabbatical approved.*

1.  **The IP Licensing Term Sheet (Draft)**
    *   *Purpose:* A "Plain English" version of the legal terms you want.
    *   *Why:* Lawyers complicate things. You need to set the boundaries (IP ownership, exclusivity, termination) *before* they draft the contract.
2.  **The "Sabbatical Continuity" Protocol**
    *   *Purpose:* A manual for how you will stay in touch while traveling.
    *   *Why:* Reassures them that you aren't disappearing. Defines "Asynchronous Check-ins" and "Emergency Channels."

## Phase 2: The "Technical Bridge" Suite (Pre-Integration)
*Focus: Speaking "Engineer" to their CTO and Dev Team.*

3.  **Cognitae x Toolhouse: Integration Specification**
    *   *Purpose:* A purely technical document showing *exactly* how the 10 Scrolls map to their API.
    *   *Why:* This is the "Instruction Manual" their engineers will read while you are away. It must be flawless.
4.  **Case Study: The Chronos Experiment**
    *   *Purpose:* A polished report on the Gaming Platform demo.
    *   *Why:* "Show, Don't Tell." It documents the 50-turn persistence stress test with charts and logs. This is for their Investors.

## Phase 3: The "Operational" Suite (During the Partnership)
*Focus: Maintaining value and visibility.*

5.  **The "Red Team" Bug Report**
    *   *Purpose:* A monthly dossier of every way you managed to break their platform.
    *   *Why:* This proves your value as a "Stress Tester." It turns failures into assets.
6.  **The "Architect's Log" (Weekly/Bi-Weekly)**
    *   *Purpose:* A high-level summary of your R&D thoughts.
    *   *Why:* Keeps you visible to the CEO even if you are working remotely/asynchronously.

## Recommendation for Next Steps
I recommend we start drafting the **Integration Specification** and the **Chronos Case Study** next. These are the "Proof of Work" that will make the negotiation (Phase 1) much easier.
