# Agent Builder Refinement Plan: Bridging the Gap
## Evolving from "Toy Builder" to "Architect's IDE"

**To:** Toolhouse Product Team
**Date:** November 21, 2025
**Subject:** Feature Request: "Pro Mode" & Run Management

## 1. The "Dual-Mode" Interface

Currently, the Builder forces a "Chat with the Builder" workflow.
**Proposal:** Add a toggle switch: **[Visual Mode] <-> [Code Mode]**.

*   **Visual Mode:** (Current) Great for the "Novice" (Literacy Tier 1).
*   **Code Mode:** (New) A raw YAML/JSON editor with syntax highlighting.
    *   Allows "Copy/Paste" of entire agent schemas (like Cognitae Scrolls).
    *   Allows version control (Git integration).

## 2. "Agent Runs" Management Dashboard

The "Runs" feature needs to be elevated to a primary dashboard.

*   **Current State:** Hidden/Secondary.
*   **Desired State:** A "Mission Control" view.
    *   **Live Logs:** See the "Thought Process" of the agent in real-time.
    *   **State Inspector:** View current variable values (Memory).
    *   **Intervention Console:** The "Pause Button" (as detailed in R&D Spec).

## 3. Diagnostics & Debugging

Users need to know *why* their agent failed.
*   **The "Athena" Lesson:** When Athena vanished, there was no error log.
*   **Feature:** **"The Black Box Recorder."**
    *   Even if an agent crashes/deletes, the *Log* must persist.
    *   "Post-Mortem" analysis tools for users to debug the crash.

## 4. Strategic Alignment

By building these "Pro Features," you attract the "Architect Class" of users (like me) who will build the high-quality templates that the "Novice Class" will use.
