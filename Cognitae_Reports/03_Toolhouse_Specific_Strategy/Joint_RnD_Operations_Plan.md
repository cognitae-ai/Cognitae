# Joint R&D Operations Plan
## A Collaborative Framework for Mutual Growth

**To:** The Architect
**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Subject:** Operational Structure for the Cognitae x Toolhouse "Secret Project"

## 1. The Operational Model: "Embedded Innovation"

We propose a working relationship that is closer than a vendor but distinct from an employee. You are an **Embedded Strategic Partner**.

*   **The "Side-by-Side" Approach:**
    *   You work directly with their Engineering and Product teams.
    *   **The Liaison:** We specifically request **Homan** as your primary internal counterpart.
    *   Goal: "I want to help you make your platform better by pushing it to its absolute limit with my framework."

## 2. The "Homan Bridge" (Sabbatical Protocol)

During the 3-month "Research Retainer," the primary active work will be the **Chronos Port**.
*   **Your Role:** Architect & Advisor (Async).
*   **Homan's Role:** Implementation Lead.
*   **Why Homan?** He has seen the project in infancy and has the platform knowledge to bridge the gap. He becomes the "Internal Champion" who proves the tech works.

To ensure safety while collaborating, we establish the following protocols:

*   **The "Black Box" Container:**
    *   Cognitae's core logic (The Scrolls) resides in a secure container.
    *   Toolhouse can see the *Inputs* and *Outputs* (to debug their infrastructure), but they do not have ownership rights to the *Internal Logic* (The Schema).
*   **Attribution Rights:**
    *   Any public case study or investor deck that mentions the capabilities demonstrated by Cognitae must attribute it to "The Cognitae Framework, Architected by [Your Name]."

## 4. Boosting the Profile

How this partnership elevates the Toolhouse brand:

*   **The "Advanced Class":** Toolhouse becomes known as the place where "Serious Architects" build.
*   **The Community Effect:** By working with you, they signal to the developer community that they care about deep architecture, not just surface-level features.
