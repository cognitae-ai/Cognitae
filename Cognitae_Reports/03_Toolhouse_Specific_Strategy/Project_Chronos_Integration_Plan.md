# Project Plan: The Chronos Integration (Starter Project)
## Phase 1: The "Homan Bridge" Protocol

**To:** The Architect
**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Subject:** Joint R&D Initiative - Gaming Agent Port

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This project serves as the **"Pilot Program"** for the broader Cognitae x Toolhouse partnership.
*   **Objective:** Port the existing "Gaming Cognitae" (Chronos/Kairos) to run natively on Toolhouse's "Agent Runs" infrastructure.
*   **Timing:** Executed during The Architect's 3-Month Sabbatical (The "Retainer Phase").
*   **Key Personnel:**
    *   **The Architect:** Strategic oversight, IP guidance, Schema definition.
    *   **Homan (Toolhouse):** Internal Lead, Platform Implementation, Infrastructure tuning.

## 2. Strategic Rationale

Why this specific project?
1.  **Low Risk, High Visibility:** Gaming agents are visually impressive demos but don't touch critical enterprise data. Perfect for a first test.
2.  **The "Homan Factor":** Homan knows the platform internals. By pairing with him, we ensure the "Cognitae Schema" is implemented correctly on their rails without you needing to write every line of glue code.
3.  **Mutual Discovery:** You learn their platform constraints; Homan learns your architectural depth.

## 3. Operational Workflow (The Sabbatical Bridge)

Since you will be traveling/recharging, the workflow is designed to be **Asynchronous**.

### Step 1: The Handoff (Week 1)
*   **Deliverable:** The "Chronos Integration Spec" (a subset of the full Cognitae spec).
*   **Action:** You walk Homan through the 10 Scrolls of Chronos.
*   **Goal:** Homan understands *what* needs to be built.

### Step 2: The Build (Weeks 2-8)
*   **Lead:** Homan.
*   **Support:** You (Weekly Check-in).
*   **Activity:** Homan attempts to map the Chronos state to "Agent Runs."
*   **The Friction:** He will hit walls. "Hey, our system can't handle this much memory."
*   **The Fix:** You provide the architectural workaround via async notes.

### Step 3: The Demo (Week 12)
*   **Event:** "The Chronos Launch."
*   **Audience:** Toolhouse CEO/CTO.
*   **Showcase:** A fully functional Gaming Agent running on Toolhouse, built by *their own engineer* (Homan) using *your architecture*.
*   **Verdict:** "If Homan can build this using Cognitae, imagine what your customers can do."

## 4. Success Metrics

*   **Persistence:** Chronos sustains 50+ turns on Toolhouse infra.
*   **Latency:** Response times remain under 2s.
*   **Knowledge Transfer:** Homan becomes the internal "Cognitae Expert."
