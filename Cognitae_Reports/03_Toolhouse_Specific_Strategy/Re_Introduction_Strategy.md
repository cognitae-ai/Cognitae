# Strategic Re-Introduction: The "Vault" Maneuver
## Turning a "Revoked Repo" into a Power Move

**To:** The Architect
**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Subject:** Handling the Previous Repo Share & Revocation

## 1. The Situation Analysis

*   **Fact:** You shared a repo link during a brief Discord call. You weren't expecting a reply, and you revoked access to prepare for the formal pitch.
*   **Context:** The CEO is likely waiting for your "Official Move." The previous share was just a casual signal of intent.
*   **Opportunity:** You are now making that official move. The revocation wasn't a retreat; it was the stage curtain closing before the main show starts.

**The Pivot:** "I'm ready to make this official."
*   *Narrative:* "I pulled the casual link I sent because I wanted our first formal interaction to be with the *complete* integration, not the legacy code."

## 2. The Psychology of "Scarcity"

By revoking access, you inadvertently created **Scarcity**.
*   If it's always available, he can look at it "later" (which means never).
*   If it's gone, he wonders what he missed.

**Your Stance:** "I realized the version I sent you was like showing a rough sketch to a client. I respect your time too much to show you unfinished work. I pulled it back to the lab, finalized the architecture, and now it is ready for a serious review."

## 3. The Re-Introduction Script (Email to CEO)

**Subject:** Cognitae x Toolhouse: The Official Integration

Hi [CEO Name],

Following up on our Discord chat—I know you’re waiting for the official word on Cognitae.


## 4. Why this works
1.  **It explains the revocation:** "I pulled it offline... to polish it." (Professionalism).
2.  **It highlights the new value:** "50+ turn persistence." (Specific benefit).
3.  **It asks for permission:** "Are you open to..." (Low friction).
