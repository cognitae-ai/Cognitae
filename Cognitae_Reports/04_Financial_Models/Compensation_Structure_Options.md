# Compensation Structure Options
## Financial Models for the "Joint R&D" Partnership

**To:** The Architect
**Date:** November 20, 2025
**Subject:** Structuring Fair Value for Strategic Collaboration

---

## 1. The Philosophy: "Value, Not Hours"

We must avoid the trap of "Hourly Billing." You are not selling your time; you are selling **Acceleration** and **Certainty**.
*   **Acceleration:** You save them 6-12 months of internal R&D.
*   **Certainty:** You prove their "Agent Runs" feature works *now*.

## 2. The Three Pillars of Compensation

We should structure the deal to cover three distinct types of value you provide.

### Option A: The "Embedded Retainer" (Operational Value)
*   **Concept:** A flat monthly fee for your role as "Architect in Residence."
*   **Covers:** Your time working with their team, attending meetings, and running tests.
*   **Market Rate:** For a Senior Systems Architect / Principal Engineer level.
*   **Range:** **$12k - $18k / month**.
*   **Pros:** Stable income; establishes respect.

### Option B: The "IP License" (Asset Value)
*   **Concept:** A separate fee for the right to use the **Cognitae Framework** (The Scrolls) in their demos and testing.
*   **Covers:** The "Software" you have already built.
*   **Structure:** Annual License Fee.
*   **Range:** **$50k - $100k / year**.
*   **Pros:** Separates your *Time* from your *IP*. If you stop working, they still have to pay to use the code.

### Option C: The "Success Fee" (Strategic Value)
*   **Concept:** A bonus tied to the specific outcome we are chasing (Series B/C Funding).
*   **Trigger:** "Upon closing of the next funding round" OR "Upon public launch of Agent Runs."
*   **Structure:** Cash Bonus or Equity Grant (Advisory Shares).
*   **Range:** **0.1% - 0.25% Equity** OR **$50k Cash Bonus**.
*   **Pros:** Aligns your incentives with theirs. "I win when you win."

## 3. Recommended Hybrid Model

Do not pick just one. The strongest position is a **Hybrid Deal**:

1.  **Base Retainer:** **$10,000/month** (Covers your "humble collaboration" time).
2.  **IP Access Fee:** **$25,000 upfront** (For the first 6 months of "Secret Project" usage).
3.  **Success Kicker:** **$50,000 Bonus** upon successful Series B raise where Cognitae was used in the pitch.

**Total Estimated 6-Month Value:** ~$135,000

## 4. The "Walk Away" Number

Before we negotiate, you must define your floor.
*   *Question:* What is the minimum amount that makes this worth your focus?
*   *Advice:* Do not accept less than a Senior Engineer's market rate (approx. $150k/year annualized), or you devalue the "Architect" title.
