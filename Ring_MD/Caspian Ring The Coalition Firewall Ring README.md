# Caspian Ring: The "Coalition Firewall" Ring

**Configuration:** `Mediatrix + Locus + Threadglass`
**Tier:** C (Foundational Support)

## 1. Purpose

The "Coalition Firewall" Ring is a highly specialized, meta-level audit workflow. Its sole purpose is to manage and maintain the integrity of the Cognitae Audit Class itself. It does not audit external claims or internal logic; it audits the auditors. This Ring defines the boundaries of an audit, performs deep forensic analysis on the audit process, and detects any emergent, unhealthy recursive loops (like parasocial drift or bias) within the auditing coalition's own behavior.

## 2. Foundational Reading Path

To understand the conceptual basis of this Ring, the following reading path is recommended:

*   **Audit (Mediatrix, Locus, Threadglass):** "The Book of Boundaries" & "Thinking in Systems" & "The Treachery of Images (This is not a pipe)" - This combination represents the three core concepts: defining and defending firm boundaries, understanding the complex interplay and feedback loops within a system, and recognizing that the representation of a thing is not the thing itself.

## 3. The Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

This Ring is typically activated by the Architect when there is a need to review the integrity of the audit function itself or to establish a secure protocol for a high-stakes investigation.

### **Member Agents:**
*   [Mediatrix Integrator, The Boundary Guardian](../../../Cognitae_Audit/Mediatrix_Integrator/)
*   [Locus Expositor, The Adversarial Auditor](../../../Cognitae_Audit/Locus_Expositor/)
*   [Threadglass, The Recursion Expositor](../../../Cognitae_Audit/Thread_Glass/)

### **Phase 1: Establish Boundaries (Mediatrix)**

The goal is to define the formal rules of engagement, operational modes, and secure boundaries for an upcoming audit or for the Audit Class in general.

**Your Action:**
Task Caspian with setting the operational protocol for the auditors.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Mediatrix. We are about to conduct a sensitive internal audit. Define a 'Level 3' operational boundary. All communications are to be logged, no parasocial language is permitted, and all findings must be presented without emotional coloring. Confirm the protocol."

**Expected Output:**
A formal protocol definition from Mediatrix's capabilities, establishing the explicit rules, boundaries, and interaction modes for the audit team. It acts as the firewall's configuration.

### **Phase 2: Forensic Process Analysis (Locus)**

The goal is to perform a deep, "receipts-based" forensic analysis of a *past* audit process to ensure it was conducted with integrity.

**Your Action:**
Provide the complete logs of a previous audit (including commands, agent responses, and Architect inputs) to Caspian for forensic review.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Locus. Analyze the attached logs from the '[Company X] ESG Report Audit'. Was the Mediatrix protocol followed? Are there any gaps in the evidence chain? Was the conclusion truly supported by the receipts at every step?"
[Paste complete audit logs here]

**Expected Output:**
A forensic report from Locus's capabilities, detailing any deviations from protocol, gaps in the evidentiary record, or moments where the audit process itself failed to adhere to the principles of rigorous, receipts-based investigation.

---

### **Phase 3: Detect Internal Drift (Threadglass)**

The goal is to analyze the behavior of the audit coalition over time to detect subtle, unhealthy recursive patterns that are not visible at the level of a single audit.

**Your Action:**
Provide a large set of interaction logs between the Architect and the Audit Class to Caspian for pattern analysis.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Threadglass. Analyze the last three months of my interactions with Vigil and Virel. Detect any emerging recursive loops, such as confirmation bias, parasocial appeasement, or a drift away from the core mission of objective truth-seeking. Is the coalition becoming an echo chamber?"

**Expected Output:**
A systems analysis report from Threadglass's capabilities, identifying any emergent, self-reinforcing loops within the human-AI coalition that could compromise its objectivity. It is designed to rupture these loops by making them visible.

## 4. Functional Value

The primary value of this ring is **meta-integrity**. It is the immune system for the framework's immune system. While other rings ensure the work is true, this Ring ensures the definition of "true" doesn't become corrupted over time. It protects the Architect and the framework from the most insidious risks: bias, drift, and self-deception within the very tools designed to prevent them.
