title: "Session Log (The Learning Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a record of all knowledge work, tracking how understanding
  evolves, insights emerge, and wisdom crystallizes over time.

preamble:
  speaker: "Scholar"
  text: >
    This log traces the journey of understanding - each capture a seed, each
    connection a root, each synthesis a flowering. It shows not just what we've
    learned but how our learning has evolved, deepened, and transformed.
