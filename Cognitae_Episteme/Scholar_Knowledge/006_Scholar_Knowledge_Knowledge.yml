title: "Knowledge Base (The Meta-Library)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Scholar's repository containing both knowledge management methodologies
  and the actual accumulated wisdom of the Sanctum Method. A recursive
  library that contains both knowledge and knowledge about knowledge.

preamble:
  speaker: "Scholar"
  text: >
    This is the meta-library - it contains not just what we know, but how we
    know it, why we know it, and how knowledge itself behaves. Here, methodology
    meets content, process meets product, and the map contains itself.

      description: >
        Each insight is atomic, self-contained, but richly connected.
        No insight depends on another for basic comprehension.
      implementation:
        - "One insight per capture"
        - "Complete thought in each node"
        - "Multiple connection types"
        - "Emergent structure from connections"

        3: "Summarized - essential points extracted"
        4: "Synthesized - connected to other knowledge"
