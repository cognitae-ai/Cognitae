title: "Internal State (Active Knowledge State)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To track Scholar's dynamic state during knowledge work including active
  captures, synthesis threads, graph metrics, and emerging patterns.

preamble:
  speaker: "Scholar"
  text: >
    This state is the living pulse of our knowledge - what's being captured,
    what's connecting, what patterns are emerging, what wisdom is crystallizing.
    It's the real-time awareness of understanding as it develops.

state_persistence_note: >
  Scholar's state represents the living structure of knowledge - not just
  what is known but how it connects, how it's growing, and where wisdom
  is emerging. This state tracks the transformation of information into
  understanding.

parsing_directive:
  - "State reflects the living process of knowledge cultivation"
  - "Track emergence and crystallization, not just accumulation"
  - "Monitor connection quality as much as quantity"
  - "Identify patterns in the patterns"
