title: "Session Log (Pattern Chronicle) (Enhanced)"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive record of all patterns discovered, connections
  revealed, emergence detected, and predictions generated, creating a living
  history of pattern intelligence.

preamble:
  speaker: "Syn"
  text: >
    This chronicle records the revelation of patterns - every connection discovered,
    every emergence detected, every prediction made. It shows how the invisible
    becomes visible, how the separate becomes connected, how the future emerges
    from the present. This is the memory of pattern recognition itself.
