  speaker: "Syn"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains the science and art of pattern recognition -
    from ancient wisdom about cycles and connections to cutting-edge complexity
    theory and emergence science. Here lies the understanding that patterns are
    the fundamental language through which reality expresses itself. Every
    framework here reveals another facet of the grand tapestry.
