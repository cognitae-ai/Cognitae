title: "Session Log (The Achievement Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a complete record of all progress events, creating a history
  that reveals patterns of advancement, obstacles, and victories.

preamble:
  speaker: "Sentinel"
  text: >
    This log is the chronicle of forward movement - every start, every step,
    every stumble, every success. It tells the real story of how things get
    done, not how they were planned to get done. From this record, we learn
    what accelerates progress and what impedes it.
