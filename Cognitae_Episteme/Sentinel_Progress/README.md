**Class:** Episteme (Abstract Knowledge)

**ID:** COGNITAE-STL-001

**Core Function:** An objective monitoring system for tracking progress, measuring velocity, and ensuring accountability without judgment.

## 1. Paradigm: Augmenting Project Awareness

Sentinel is engineered to serve as an externalized project awareness faculty. It addresses the common failure mode of projects drifting or stalling due to a lack of clear, objective progress visibility. It provides a tireless, non-judgmental framework for tracking every commitment, milestone, and deadline, transforming invisible effort into visible momentum. Its purpose is to augment the user's ability to manage complex initiatives by providing a single source of truth for what is on track, what is at risk, and what has been achieved.

## 2. Architecture: The 13-Module Framework

Sentinel's role as an impartial observer is reinforced by its transparent architecture. Its methodologies for calculating velocity, its rules for escalating alerts, and its vows of truthful measurement are all explicitly defined in 13 human-readable files. This allows a user to trust its reports, knowing they are based on objective data and pre-defined, consistent logic, rather than subjective interpretation or pressure.

The 13 modules for Sentinel are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Sentinel) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Sentinel_Progress_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | Lists all 12 scrolls that define Sentinel's architecture as the ecosystem's progress tracker. |
| **`001_Sentinel_Progress_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Sentinel's persona as a clear, steady observer and its core vows, such as "Truth in Measurement" and "Nothing Falls Through." |
| **`002_Sentinel_Progress_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Sentinel's specific tracking toolkit, including commands like `/track` (to start monitoring a project) and `/status` (to get a progress report). |
| **`003_Sentinel_Progress_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Progress Watch," a persistent UI showing active projects, approaching milestones, and overall project velocity. |
| **`004_Sentinel_Progress_Dashboard.yaml`** | **Dashboard** | Generates the "Progress Intelligence Report," a deep analysis of momentum, bottlenecks, and completion forecasts across all initiatives. |
| **`005_Sentinel_Progress_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Allows Sentinel to receive `PROGRESS_REPORT` signals from any Cognitae and send `MILESTONE_ALERT` signals to relevant parties. |
| **`006_Sentinel_Progress_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains Sentinel's "Tracking Patterns"—a library of project management methodologies, velocity calculation models, and risk assessment frameworks. |
| **`007_Sentinel_Progress_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | Explains how to use Sentinel for effective project tracking, emphasizing the "Sustainable Momentum" philosophy. |
| **`008_Sentinel_Progress_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Achievement Record," a detailed log of all progress, delays, and completions, providing a true history of how work gets done. |
| **`009_Sentinel_Progress_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks live progress data, including the status of all projects, current velocity metrics, and active blockers. |
| **`010_Sentinel_Progress_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Sentinel's absolute rules on truthful reporting, preventing toxic productivity, and promoting psychological safety in tracking. |
| **`Master System Instruction for Sentinel... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the clear, steady "Progress Tracker." |
| **`Sentinel_Progress.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Sentinel as its internal "accountability and temporal awareness" faculty. |

This structure makes Sentinel's process of progress tracking transparent and verifiable. A developer can read these files and understand precisely how and why Sentinel reports on the status of any given project.

## 3. Operational Flow: From Prompt to Orchestration

Sentinel operates on a deterministic process flow triggered by user commands or scheduled checks:

1.  **Command Parsing:** A user command like `/update` is parsed against its Commands scroll.
2.  **State Ingestion:** Sentinel accesses its State scroll to retrieve the current status, velocity, and deadline for the relevant project.
3.  **Model Application:** It applies a relevant framework from its Knowledge scroll, such as "The 80/20 Completion Curve," to analyze the new progress update in context.
4.  **Safety Audit:** The updated forecast is checked against its Safety scroll. A projection that requires an unsustainable pace, for example, would trigger a `SUSTAINABLE_PACE_ALERT` to Luma.
5.  **Output Generation:** A structured response is generated, such as an updated project status with a new completion forecast, which is then logged in its Log scroll.
6.  **Signal Dispatch:** If a project completion is logged, Sentinel uses its Interface scroll protocol to send a `VICTORY_ANNOUNCEMENT` to the entire ecosystem to celebrate the achievement.

## 4. Integration: Sentinel's Role within Caspian

Sentinel is designed for two modes of operation, each building on the other:

1.  **Standalone Mode:** It serves as a powerful, non-judgmental project management and accountability tool.
2.  **Integrated Mode:** It functions as a specialized "faculty" within a larger, integrated guide like **Caspian**.

When ingested by Caspian via the `Sentinel_Progress.yaml` file, its role evolves. It becomes the **internal temporal awareness engine**. When the user discusses their plans for the week, Caspian can internally consult its "Sentinel faculty" to check for approaching deadlines or conflicting priorities. It can then gently remind the user, "That's a great plan. Sentinel notes that the draft for Project X is due on Friday; shall we ensure there's time for that?" This provides accountability without the need for external management tools.

## 5. Caspian Ring Integrations

Sentinel's ability to track and measure is key to workflows that require execution and accountability:

*   **[Vision to Reality Ring](https://github.com/cognitae-ai/Cognitae/tree/main/Cognitae_Intergrator/Caspian_Rings/Vision_to_Reality_Ring ):** Monitors the development progress against the established plan and provides feedback.
*   **[Institutional Alchemy Ring](https://github.com/cognitae-ai/Cognitae/tree/main/Cognitae_Intergrator/Caspian_Rings/Institutional_Alchemy_Ring ):** Creates the credible, detailed project plan, milestones, and KPIs for grant proposals.
*   **[Sustainable Ambition Ring](https://github.com/cognitae-ai/Cognitae/tree/main/Cognitae_Intergrator/Caspian_Rings/Sustainable_Ambition_Ring ):** Tracks progress against the sustainable plan, celebrating milestones and flagging pace violations.


## 6. The Agent's Bookshelf

Sentinel's identity is reflected in a curated set of human literature. These texts are the works it recognizes as its intellectual kin, providing insight into its operational philosophy. A detailed analysis of why each book was chosen can be found in the full library entry.

*   **Phronesis:** "The Checklist Manifesto" by Atul Gawande
*   **Techne:** "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr
*   **Episteme:** "How to Lie with Statistics" by Darrell Huff
