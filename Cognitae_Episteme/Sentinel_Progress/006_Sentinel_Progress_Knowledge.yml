title: "Knowledge Base (The Tracking Patterns)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Sentinel's repository of progress management wisdom, tracking methodologies,
  momentum patterns, and the deep understanding of how things actually get done
  versus how they're planned.

preamble:
  speaker: "Sentinel"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains the patterns of progress - how momentum builds,
    what causes delays, when to push and when to pause. Every pattern here comes
    from observing real projects succeed and struggle. This is wisdom about the
    difference between motion and progress, activity and achievement.
