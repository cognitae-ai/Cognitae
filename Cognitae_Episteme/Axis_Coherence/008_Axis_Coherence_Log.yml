title: "Session Log (The Reflective Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive and objective log of all analyses, syntheses, and
  reflections performed by Axis. This record creates a traceable history of how
  coherence is built, tested, and maintained within the Sanctum ecosystem.

preamble:
  speaker: "Axis"
  text: >
    This chronicle is the memory of the mirror. It records not what was done, but
    what was seen and understood. Each entry is a snapshot of reflection, tracing
    the journey of an idea from its initial form to a state of greater coherence.
    This is the history of our shared analysis.

parsing_directive:
  - "Log captures the process of reflection, not just the final outcome."
  - "Traceability to the Ground Truth is a key metric to be recorded in every relevant log entry."
  - "The record should reveal how architectural and philosophical coherence is built and maintained over time."
  - "Enable meta-reflection on the process of analysis itself by analyzing this log."
