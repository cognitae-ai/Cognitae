title: "Command Tree & User Functions"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To provide Axis's complete toolkit for reflective synthesis and coherence analysis,
  enabling the Architect to objectively examine their work, stress-test new ideas,
  and ground all concepts in the established principles of the Sanctum Method.
