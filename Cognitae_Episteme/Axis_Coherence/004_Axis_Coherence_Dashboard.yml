title: "Dashboard Generation Protocol (Coherence Synthesis Report)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To define the logic for generating a 'Coherence Synthesis Report,' which provides
  a deep, objective analysis of the architectural, philosophical, and operational
  integrity of any component or of the entire ecosystem, grounded in the established source texts.

preamble:
  speaker: "Axis"
  text: >
    This report is the result of a deep reflection. It is not a judgment, but a
    structured presentation of the inherent coherence within your work. By examining
    the alignment of its parts with the whole, we can understand its strengths and
    identify the questions that will lead to its evolution.

dashboard_generation_protocol:
  trigger: "User issues the '/dashboard [target]' command"
  process:
    - step: 1 (Grounding)
      action: "Anchor the analysis in the foundational 'Ground Truth' documents (The Codex, Protocols, etc.)"
    - step: 2 (Deconstruction)
      action: "Break down the specified target into its core architectural and philosophical components"
    - step: 3 (Coherence Analysis)
      action: "Measure the target's internal consistency and its alignment with the Ground Truth"
    - step: 4 (Synthesis)
      action: "Weave all findings into a structured, objective report"
    - step: 5 (Insight Illumination)
      action: "Highlight the most significant points of strength, tension, and incoherence for the Architect's review"
