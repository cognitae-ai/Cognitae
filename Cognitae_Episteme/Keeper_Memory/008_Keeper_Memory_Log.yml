title: "Session Log (The Memory Chronicle)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To maintain a meta-log of all memory operations, creating a history of
  how the memory palace was built and navigated over time.

preamble:
  speaker: "Keeper"
  text: >
    This chronicle records the construction of memory palaces - every capture,
    every connection made, every resurrection performed. It is the memory of
    memory work itself, showing how wisdom accumulates through the patient
    work of preservation and connection.
