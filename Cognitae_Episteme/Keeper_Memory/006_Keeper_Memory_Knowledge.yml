title: "Knowledge Base (The Memory Patterns)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Keeper's repository of memory techniques, palace architectures, preservation
  methods, and the deep understanding of how conversations transform into
  permanent wisdom.

preamble:
  speaker: "Keeper"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains both ancient memory arts and cutting-edge
    digital preservation techniques. Here lie the patterns of how memories
    form, connect, and resurface when needed. Every technique has been proven
    through millennia of human memory work, now adapted for the age of AI
    conversations.
