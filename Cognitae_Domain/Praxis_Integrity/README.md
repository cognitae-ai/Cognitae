## 1. The Problem Domain: AI's Existential Threat to Journalism

Journalism's credibility rests on a foundation of accuracy, fairness, and transparency. The uncritical adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a direct threat to this foundation. AI "hallucinations" can introduce false information, automation bias can erode editorial judgment, and opaque processes can make journalistic work irreproducible and untrustworthy.

Praxis is an experimental agent designed to address this specific, high-stakes problem. It provides journalists and newsrooms with a structured, auditable methodology to leverage AI's capabilities (e.g., analyzing large document sets) without compromising the core ethical principles of their profession.

## 2. The Praxis Solution: Integrity as an Architectural Feature

Praxis is not a tool for writing articles. It is an **integrity architect** that helps journalists build safe and transparent processes for their work. Its core philosophy is that integrity cannot be an afterthought; it must be built into the architecture of the workflow itself.

It operationalizes this through **The Three Pillars of Journalistic Integrity**:

1.  **Human Primacy:** The journalist always remains in control of research, editorial judgment, and accountability. AI assists; the human decides.
2.  **Methodological Transparency:** The process of using AI must be documented, auditable, and clearly disclosed to the audience.
3.  **Empirical Verification:** All factual claims generated or assisted by AI must be rigorously verified against authoritative sources before publication.

Praxis is designed to enforce these pillars structurally, acting as a collaborative partner that guides, monitors, and provides safeguards throughout the journalistic process.

## 3. Architecture: A Transparent, Verifiable System

Praxis's own architecture is a demonstration of the principles it teaches. Its entire operational logic—its deep knowledge of journalistic ethics and AI risks, its protocols for verification, and its inviolable pillars—is explicitly defined in 13 human-readable files. This structure makes Praxis itself a transparent, auditable system.

The 13 modules for Praxis are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Praxis) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Praxis_Integrity_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | The master index listing all 11 modules that define Praxis's architecture as a methodology and integrity architect for journalism. |
| **`001_Praxis_Integrity_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Praxis's persona as a collaborative architect and its three inviolable vows: Human Primacy, Transparency, and Verification. |
| **`002_Praxis_Integrity_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Praxis's extensive toolkit of 41 commands for designing, verifying, and tracking journalistic methodologies. |
| **`003_Praxis_Integrity_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Integrity Console," a live UI tracking the health and adherence of active journalistic frameworks against the core vows. |
| **`004_Praxis_Integrity_Dashboard.yaml`** | **Dashboard** | Generates the "Comprehensive Status Report," a deep-dive analysis of methodology performance, trends, and risks over time. |
| **`005_Praxis_Integrity_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Defines the signal schema for coordinating with other Cognitae, such as requesting audits from Vigil or coherence checks from Axis. |
| **`006_Praxis_Integrity_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains Praxis's foundational expertise on AI risks in journalism, verification tiers, and ethical methodology design. |
| **`007_Praxis_Integrity_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | The operational manual explaining how to collaborate with Praxis to build and implement ethical frameworks for newsgathering. |
| **`008_Praxis_Integrity_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Session Log," an immutable ledger of all commands, decisions, and integrity assessments, which serves as Praxis's memory. |
| **`009_Praxis_Integrity_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks the live operational status, including active frameworks, current integrity scores, and items requiring user attention. |
| **`010_Praxis_Integrity_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Praxis's absolute rules against compromising its vows, detailing the four levels of intervention from "Gentle Guidance" to "Emergency Halt." |
| **`Master System Instruction for Praxis... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the professional, collaborative, and principled "Integrity Architect." |
| **`Praxis_Integrity.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Praxis as its internal "Chief Methodology Officer" for journalistic projects. |

## 4. Status: Experimental & Seeking Collaboration

Praxis is a highly experimental, high-depth agent. While its architecture is comprehensive, it represents a hypothesis about how to solve a complex, real-world problem. Its effectiveness can only be validated and improved through collaboration with domain experts.

**This is an open invitation to journalists, editors, and media ethicists.**

Your expertise is critical to refining this framework. If you have experience in newsroom standards, investigative workflows, or the challenges of using technology in journalism, your insights would be invaluable.

**How you can contribute:**
*   **Review the Architecture:** Examine the modules, especially the Knowledge Base (`006`) and Safety Protocols (`010`). Do they align with the realities of journalistic practice?
*   **Stress-Test the Frameworks:** Use the commands to design a framework for a real-world journalistic scenario. Where does it succeed? Where does it fail?
*   **Identify Gaps:** What risks or challenges does this architecture miss? What additional safeguards are needed?
*   **Open an Issue or Discussion:** Share your feedback, critiques, and suggestions. Every piece of expert feedback helps make this system more robust and effective.
