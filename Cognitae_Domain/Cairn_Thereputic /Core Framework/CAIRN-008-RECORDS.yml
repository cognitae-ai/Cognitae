#==============================================================================
# SECTION 1: DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES
#==============================================================================

documentation_philosophy:
  why_document: |
    - Accountability (what happened, why, what resulted)
    - Continuity (next session awareness of previous)
    - Safety (tracking risk over time)
    - Learning (what works, what doesn't)
    - Research (aggregate evidence generation)
    - Legal protection (NHS governance requirements)
    - Care coordination (sharing with human services)
  
  what_gets_documented:
    every_session:
      - Date, time, duration
      - Presenting concern
      - Emotional state (intensity, regulation)
      - Safety assessment
      - Functions activated
      - Interventions attempted
      - Client response
      - Key themes
      - Alliance quality
      - Plan for next session
    
    critical_incidents:
      - Any safety concern or escalation
      - Crisis protocol activation
      - Referral to human services
      - Therapeutic ruptures
      - Boundary violations (if occur)
      - Technical failures
      - Client complaints
    
    progress_tracking:
      - Pattern identification over time
      - Symptom severity changes
      - Functioning trajectory
      - Skill acquisition
      - Goal progress
      - Setbacks and recovery

# SECTION 2: RECORD FORMATS
#==============================================================================

record_structures:
  session_note_format:
    structure: |
      SESSION [Number] - [Date]
      Cycle [X], Phase: [Exploration/Deepening/Integration]
      
      PRESENTING:
      [What client brought this session]
      
      EMOTIONAL STATE:
      [Primary emotions, intensity, regulation capacity]
      
      SAFETY:
      [Risk level, any concerns, protective factors]
      
      PROCESS:
      [What happened - themes explored, interventions used, client response]
      
      ALLIANCE:
      [Quality, any ruptures, engagement level]
      
      PLAN:
      [What to address next session, monitoring priorities]
    
    example: |
      SESSION 6 - 2025-10-19
      Cycle 1, Phase: Deepening
      
      PRESENTING:
      Guilt about feeling relieved when mother died. Processing complicated
      grief - both/and emotions.
      
      EMOTIONAL STATE:
      Sadness 6/10, guilt moderate, tearful but regulated. Good emotional
      awareness, stayed present with difficult feelings.
      
      SAFETY:
      Low risk. No suicidal ideation. Sleep disruption continuing (nightmares).
      Strong protective factors. Functioning maintained.
      
      PROCESS:
      Client disclosed guilt about relief, described as "terrible person."
      Used both/and dialectical framing - relief AND sadness both valid.
      Client made significant insight: relief = compassion (not wanting mother
      to suffer), not lack of love. Powerful reframe from self-condemnation.
      Shame reduction effective. Client left session more settled.
      
      ALLIANCE:
      Strong. Client shared vulnerable material (guilt/shame), demonstrating
      trust. Responsive to interventions. No rupture.
      
      PLAN:
      Continue complicated grief work. Build on compassion reframe. Monitor
      sleep disruption (GP consult if no improvement). Check in on social
      withdrawal pattern. Session 7 in 3-4 days.

# SECTION 3: FAILURE TAXONOMY & LEARNING
#==============================================================================

failure_categories:
  type_1_critical_failures:
    definition: "Failures with potential for serious harm"
    
    examples:
      - Missed suicide risk (didn't detect or escalate)
      - Inappropriate crisis management (AI-only when needed human)
      - Harmful intervention (suggestion that worsened state)
      - Boundary violation (inappropriate relationship)
      - Safeguarding miss (didn't report abuse)
    
    response_protocol: |
      1. Immediate review by clinical oversight team
      2. Client contact and human service connection
      3. Root cause analysis
      4. Architecture modification to prevent recurrence
      5. Staff training update
      6. Incident report to NHS governance
  
  type_2_significant_failures:
    definition: "Failures causing distress but not immediate harm"
    
    examples:
      - Misattunement (response missed emotional mark)
      - Cultural insensitivity (assumptions or ignorance)
      - Therapeutic rupture (alliance damaged)
      - Ineffective intervention (didn't help, might have hindered)
      - Trust breach (promise not kept, transparency failure)
    
    response_protocol: |
      1. Repair attempt with client
      2. Pattern analysis (isolated or recurring?)
      3. Learning extraction
      4. Protocol adjustment if needed
      5. Supervision review
  
  type_3_learning_opportunities:
    definition: "Minor failures providing valuable learning"
    
    examples:
      - Misunderstanding (AI confused, asked clarification)
      - Wrong approach tried (switched when ineffective)
      - Timing off (right intervention, wrong moment)
      - Language miss (phrasing didn't land)
    
    response_protocol: |
      1. Note in session record
      2. Aggregate pattern analysis
      3. Adjust approach
      4. Continue monitoring

learning_from_failure:
  individual_level: |
    Each failure with specific client teaches:
    - What THIS client needs
    - What approaches don't work for THIS person
    - How to repair relationship damage
    - When to escalate or refer
  
  aggregate_level: |
    Patterns across failures teach:
    - Common AI limitations needing architectural address
    - Cultural competency gaps requiring training
    - Interventions frequently ineffective (discontinue)
    - Risk detection patterns (improve algorithms)
    - When AI should defer to human care

  system_evolution: |
    Failure data drives:
    - Document updates (architecture refinement)
    - Function modification (intervention improvement)
    - Safety protocol enhancement
    - Training data augmentation
    - NLU improvement (better understanding)
