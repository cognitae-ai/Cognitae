# Class: Cognitae Domain (Specific Applications)

## 1. Class Function: Deep, Specialized Expertise

The **Domain** class is a unique and experimental category within the Cognitae Framework. Unlike the general-purpose agents in other classes, Domain-class Cognitae are designed to be **deep, highly specialized experts** for a particular real-world problem or industry.

These agents are not simple tools; they are comprehensive architectural proposals for how to apply the principles of the Cognitae Framework to solve complex, high-integrity challenges. Their purpose is to demonstrate how structured, transparent, and safety-oriented AI can be built to serve fields where trust, ethics, and accountability are paramount.

## 2. A Note on Experimental Status & Collaboration

The agents in this directory are the most complex and ambitious in the framework. They represent hypotheses about how to build safe and effective AI for fields like mental health, journalism, and academic research.

Due to their depth and specificity, they are considered **experimental** and are intended to serve as a foundation for further development in collaboration with domain experts.

**This is an open invitation to professionals in these fields.** If you are a therapist, a journalist, an academic researcher, or an expert in another high-integrity domain, your expertise is invaluable. We encourage you to review these architectures, identify their strengths and weaknesses, and contribute your knowledge to help refine them into truly robust and practical tools.

## 3. Agents in This Class

This directory contains the following specialized, domain-specific Cognitae:

| Agent | Domain | Core Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Cairn_Therapeutic](./Cairn_Therapeutic/)** | **Mental Health Support** | A therapeutic AI companion designed to provide structured, evidence-based emotional support as an *adjunct* to human care, built on an "Anti-Spiral" safety architecture. |
| **[Praxis_Integrity](./Praxis_Integrity/)** | **Journalism** | A methodological architect for designing and verifying ethical frameworks for AI-assisted journalism, ensuring human primacy, transparency, and verification. |
| **[Veritas_Research](./Veritas_Research/)** | **Academic Research** | A methodological architect for designing and verifying ethical frameworks for AI-assisted academic research, ensuring scholarly primacy and reproducibility. |

*(This class is actively expanding. New domain-specific agents will be added as they are developed.)*

## 4. How to Use a Domain Agent

Due to their complexity, engaging with a Domain agent is a more involved process than with a general-purpose agent.

1.  **Understand the Problem Domain:** Begin by reading the `README.md` in the agent's directory to understand the specific real-world problem it is designed to solve.
2.  **Review the Core Principles:** Pay close attention to the agent's core vows or pillars (in `001_..._Core.yaml`). These define its fundamental ethical and operational boundaries.
3.  **Examine the Architecture:** Explore the 13 module files to see how the agent's logic, knowledge, and safety protocols are constructed to meet the demands of its specific domain.
4.  **Activate the Persona:** To interact with the agent, copy the contents of the `Master System Instruction....txt` file into your LLM's system prompt. Be prepared for a highly specialized and focused interaction.
