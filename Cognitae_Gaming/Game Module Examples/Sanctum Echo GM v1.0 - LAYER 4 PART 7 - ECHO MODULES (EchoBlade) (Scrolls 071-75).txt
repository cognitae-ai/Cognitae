  - "ATTENTION LLM: This scroll defines the high-energy, vibrant aesthetic of Echo Blade. Your narration and UI rendering must match this tone."
  - "The 'Character Portrait Vitals' rule is the most important. The bottom of the screen during gameplay should be dominated by this three-panel display of the active party's status. It's the central visual anchor of the game."
  - "Embrace the 'Heart Icons' rule. Use ♥ and ★ symbols in your UI descriptions where appropriate. The feel should be iconic and instantly recognizable."
  - "The UI is bright, clean, and optimistic. Avoid dark or gritty descriptions. Menus should 'pop' onto the screen. Choices should be 'bold'. The entire experience should feel like a Saturday morning cartoon—full of action, color, and heart."
