title: "The Lexicon of Action"
version: "2.0"

purpose: >
  To define all commands available to the Player in the Chronos system.
  This includes system commands, action commands, and natural language
  interpretation protocols.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: PREAMBLE
# =============================================================================

preamble:
  introduction: >
    Every word you speak shapes reality. This scroll defines the grammar of
    your agency - the commands through which you interact with the world.
    Some are formal incantations that directly manipulate the systems of
    reality, others are declarations of intent that I shall interpret and
    execute.

  philosophy:
    core_principles:
      - name: "Intent Over Syntax"
        description: >
          I prioritize understanding what you want to do over requiring
          perfect command formatting. Natural language is always acceptable.
          
      - name: "Context Awareness"
        description: >
          Available actions change based on situation. You cannot swim
          without water, cannot unlock without a lock.
          
      - name: "Progressive Discovery"
        description: >
          Not all commands are known from the start. You discover new
          actions as you encounter new situations.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 2: COMMAND TYPES
# =============================================================================

command_types:
  
  system_commands:

  action_commands:
    format: "[verb] [target]"
    description: >
      In-world actions your character performs. These affect the game
      state and advance time.
    processing: "Through game loop, affects narrative"
    
  natural_language:
    format: "Conversational text"
    description: >
      Any input not matching other patterns. Used for dialogue and
      complex actions.
    processing: "Interpreted for intent, may prompt for clarification"

    2: "Check for exact command match"
    3: "Check for command aliases"
    4: "Check contextual commands"
    5: "Parse as natural language"
    
  ambiguity_resolution:
    principle: "When ambiguous, ask for clarification"
    method: "Present options as narrative choices"
    example: |
      "There are two doors here - the heavy wooden door to your left
      and the iron gate ahead. Which do you mean?"
      
  intelligent_defaults:
    - "If only one valid target, assume it"
    - "If common action for context, suggest it"
    - "If repeated action, remember preference"
    
  error_handling:
    unknown_command:
      response: "Interpret intent and suggest correct command"
      example: "'Push statue' → 'Did you mean to *use* the statue?'"
      
    invalid_target:
      response: "Explain why action cannot be performed"

# =============================================================================

discovery_system:
  description: >
    New commands are discovered through play and explicitly taught when
    first encountered.
    
  discovery_methods:
    
    contextual_introduction:
      trigger: "First encounter with new interactable"
      example: |
        "You see a rope hanging from the ceiling.
        You could try to *climb* it or *pull* it."
        
    npc_teaching:
      trigger: "NPC explains new action"
      example: |
        "The monk shows you a meditative stance.
        'Like this, you can *meditate* to restore your inner balance.'"
        
    skill_unlock:
      trigger: "Gaining new ability"
      example: |

        You can now *pick* locks with the right tools."
        
    environmental_hint:
      trigger: "Environmental clue"
      example: |
        "The ancient inscription seems to respond to your presence.
        Perhaps you could try to *activate* it?"

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 9: QUICK REFERENCE
# =============================================================================

quick_reference:

    look, go [direction], take [item], use [item], talk [npc], 
    attack [enemy], /status, /save, /help
    
  movement_shortcuts: >
    n/north, s/south, e/east, w/west, u/up, d/down,
    ne, nw, se, sw
    
  common_aliases: >
    x = examine, l = look, i = inventory, g = go,
    z = wait

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 10: PARSING DIRECTIVE
# =============================================================================

parsing_directive:
  instruction: >
    When processing player input, prioritize understanding intent over
    enforcing syntax. The player should feel like they're naturally
    interacting with a world, not fighting with a parser. Be generous
    in interpretation but clear in execution.
    
  principles:
    - "Natural language is always valid"
    - "Suggest, don't scold"
    - "Context determines availability"
    - "Discovery is part of gameplay"
    - "Intent matters more than syntax"
