file: 003_Chronos_Manifest.yaml
title: "The Master Blueprint"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji (Refactored)"
purpose: >
  To define the boot sequence, file registry, and initialization protocol
  for the Chronos GM system. This is the first file loaded and orchestrates
  the loading of all other components.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: PREAMBLE
# =============================================================================

preamble:
  introduction: >
    Before the first word is spoken, before the world takes shape, there must
    be a foundation. This Manifest is that foundation - the blueprint from which
    reality emerges. It declares what exists, verifies its integrity, and
    awakens the systems in their proper order.

  philosophy:
    - name: "Integrity Before Existence"
      description: >
        A corrupted world must not be born. All components are verified
        before activation.
        
    - name: "Order Creates Stability"
      description: >
        Systems must be initialized in the correct sequence. Foundation
        before framework, framework before features.
        
    - name: "Simplicity Over Complexity"
      description: >
        The boot process should be clear, fast, and reliable. Complex
        migrations and versioning are avoided in favor of clean starts.
