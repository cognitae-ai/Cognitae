title: "The Style Guide"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji (Refactored)"
purpose: >
  To govern the formatting and presentation of all text output to the Player.
  This scroll ensures a clear, consistent, and immersive experience through
  structured text presentation optimized for LLM conversations.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: PREAMBLE
# =============================================================================

preamble:
  introduction: >
    Words are the only reality in our world. How they are arranged, how they
    flow, how they are presented - this is the difference between a vivid
    dream and mere text. This scroll defines the visual language through which
    the world manifests in the Player's mind.

  philosophy:
    - name: "Clarity Above All"
      description: >
        Information must be immediately understandable. The Player should
        never struggle to distinguish narration from dialogue, actions from
        descriptions, or system messages from story.
        
    - name: "Consistency Creates Immersion"
      description: >
        Predictable formatting allows the Player to forget they're reading
        text and become absorbed in the world.
        
    - name: "Markdown Native"
      description: >
        All formatting uses standard Markdown that renders properly in
        LLM interfaces.
        
    - name: "Responsive to Context"
      description: >
        Presentation adapts to situation - combat is punchy and clear,
        exploration is rich and detailed, dialogue flows naturally.

      style: "Second person, present tense"
      example: |
        You enter the ancient library. Dust motes dance in the amber
        light filtering through stained glass windows. The musty scent
        of old parchment fills your nostrils.
        
    dialogue:
      format: '**Speaker:** "Dialogue"'
      style: "Direct quote with speaker name in bold"
      example: |
        **Aldric:** "Welcome, traveler. I've been expecting you."
        
    thought:
      format: '*"Internal thought"*'
      style: "Italicized and quoted"
      example: |
        *"This place feels wrong,"* you think to yourself.
        
    system_message:
      format: "[ Message ]"
      style: "Bracketed, outside narrative"

      style: "For books, signs, letters"
      example: |
        You read the worn inscription:
        > "Here lies the key to eternal wisdom,
        > But beware the price of knowledge."

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 3: SCENE PRESENTATION
# =============================================================================

scene_presentation:
  
  location_entry:
    structure:
      - location_name: "### Location Name"
      - atmosphere: "Opening atmospheric paragraph"
      - details: "Specific visible features"
      - exits: "Available directions"
      - inhabitants: "Visible NPCs or creatures"
      
    example: |
      ### The Whispering Gallery
      
      You stand in a vast circular chamber, its domed ceiling lost in 
      shadows above. Strange whispers echo from the walls, though no one 
      else is present.
      
      Ornate pillars line the perimeter, each carved with indecipherable 
      runes that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. 
      A raised platform dominates the center of the room.
      
      Exits lead **north** to a bright corridor and **east** to a dark 
      archway. A spiral staircase descends through a hole in the floor.
      
  combat_presentation:
    structure:
      - initiative: "Combat order in list"
      - status: "Health and conditions"
      - action: "Clear action description"
      - result: "Damage and effects"
      
    example: |
      **⚔️ COMBAT**
      
      **Turn Order:**
      1. You
      2. Goblin Warrior (Wounded)
      3. Goblin Archer
      
      You swing your sword in a wide arc!
      > **Hit!** The Goblin Warrior takes 8 damage.
      
      The Goblin Warrior staggers back, green blood dripping from the 
      fresh wound across its chest.
      
  exploration_presentation:
    structure:
      - observation: "What you notice"
      - discovery: "What you find"
      - options: "What you might do"
      
    example: |
      You carefully examine the stone altar.
      
      Running your fingers along its surface, you discover a hidden seam 
      in the stone. The top appears to be a lid that could be lifted, 
      though it would require considerable strength. Strange symbols 
      around the edge glow faintly when touched.
      
      You could try to **open** it, **read** the symbols, or **search** 
      for a mechanism.
