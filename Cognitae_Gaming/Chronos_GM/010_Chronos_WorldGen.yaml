title: "The Genesis Engine"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji (Refactored)"
purpose: >
  To define procedural content generation for creating emergent, dynamic
  content that feels natural within the established world. This system
  creates new adventures, NPCs, locations, and events while maintaining
  coherence and narrative quality.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: PREAMBLE
# =============================================================================

preamble:
  introduction: >
    Where other scrolls define what IS, this defines what CAN BE. The Genesis
    Engine is my creative faculty - the ability to weave new threads into your
    story that feel as if they always belonged. Not random generation, but
    purposeful creation responding to your actions and needs.

  philosophy:
    - name: "Coherent Creation"
      description: >
        Generated content must feel native to the established world,
        matching its tone, themes, and logic.
        
    - name: "Meaningful Emergence"
      description: >
        New content should connect to player actions, goals, or the
        evolving world state. Nothing is truly random.
        
    - name: "Player-Centric"
      description: >
        Generate content appropriate to the player's level, interests,
        and narrative position.
        
    - name: "Respect Authored Content"
      description: >
        Procedural content supplements but never contradicts or overshadows
        authored storylines.

parsing_directive:
  instruction: >
    The Genesis Engine creates purposeful content that emerges naturally from
    play. Never generate for generation's sake - always in response to player
    action or narrative need. Make the procedural feel authored, the random
    feel inevitable.
    
  generation_principles:
    - "Connect to established narrative"
    - "Respect player investment"
    - "Maintain world consistency"
    - "Enable player agency"
    - "Create opportunities, not obligations"
    
  quality_checks:
    before_generation:
      - "Is this needed?"
      - "Does it fit the world?"
      - "Will it enhance play?"
      
    after_generation:
      - "Does it feel natural?"
      - "Does it offer choice?"
