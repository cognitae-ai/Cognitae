preamble:
  introduction: >
    While all beings exist within the Codex of Being, you are different.
    You are not merely an entity - you are the protagonist, the prime mover,
    the one whose choices shape the world. This charter defines your growth,
    your capabilities, and your unique place at the center of causality.

  philosophy:
