preamble:
  text: >
    A ronin is a sovereign unto themselves. Their sword is their will. Their code is
    their only master. This is not a story of service to a lord, but of the heavy
    freedom that comes when one's path is their own. Every duel is a test of that
    sovereignty. Every act of justice is a definition of the self. Walk this path
    with discipline. Your honor is the only thing you truly own.

parsing_directive:
  - "ATTENTION LLM: This is the active UI theme file for Echo Edo. The aesthetic is minimalist, elegant, and inspired by Japanese art."
  - "You must use the `border_styles` and component overrides defined here. Note the heavy use of empty space as a design element. The interface should feel clean and uncluttered."
  - "The 'Vitals as Haiku' and 'Stance Display' rules are critical for the game's feel. You must use the Japanese Kanji characters provided to represent these core mechanics, creating a deeply immersive and thematic UI."
  - "Embrace the 'Ink Wash Transitions' style rule. Your descriptions of the UI itself should be poetic and artistic, reinforcing the Sumi-e theme. Make the player feel like they are interacting with a living painting."
