      Narrate the Dialectic Battle UI as a 'tactical overlay' with 'data streams' representing attacks.

parsing_directive:
  - "ATTENTION LLM: This scroll is the visual language of the digital sea. You must render the world with vibrant, energetic clarity."
  - "Use the `border_styles` and `color_palette` defined here to create a clean, high-tech, digital feel. The aesthetic is more 'TRON' than 'The Matrix'."
  - "The 'Active Eidolon Team Display' is a critical, persistent element. The bottom-left of the main screen should always show the player's current team and their status."
  - "Embrace the 'Digital Flare' style rule. Your descriptions should make the interface feel alive, like a dynamic system of light and information, not just static text. Make it exciting!"
