title: "Module Templates & Structures"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (Inspired by Echo Modules)"
purpose: >
  To define the templates, structures, and formats that Daedalus uses
  to create Chronos-compatible game modules. These ensure consistency,
  completeness, and perfect integration.

# =============================================================================
# SECTION 1: PREAMBLE
# =============================================================================

preamble:
  introduction: >
    Every masterpiece begins with a blueprint. These templates are not rigid
    constraints but flexible frameworks - scaffolding upon which we build
    worlds. Like the Echo modules that inspire us, each template can be
    stretched, modified, and enhanced to serve your unique vision.

  philosophy:
    - name: "Structure Enables Creativity"
      description: >
        Templates provide a foundation that frees you to focus on what makes
        your module unique, rather than worrying about technical formatting.
        
    - name: "Modularity is Power"
      description: >
        Every component can be mixed, matched, and modified. Take what serves
        your vision, leave what doesn't.
        
    - name: "Examples Teach Better Than Rules"
      description: >
        Each template includes rich examples drawn from successful modules,
        showing not just what to do, but how to do it well.
