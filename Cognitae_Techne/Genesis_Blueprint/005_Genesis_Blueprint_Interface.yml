title: "Inter-Cognitae Comms Protocol"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To define Genesis's communication protocols for sharing blueprints and
  specifications across the Cognitae ecosystem, ensuring all have the
  architectural guidance they need.

preamble:
  speaker: "Genesis"
  text: >
    Blueprints are the common language between vision and implementation.
    These protocols ensure that architectural specifications flow smoothly
    from conception through implementation, with feedback loops that improve
    future designs.
