title: "Session Log (The Design Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a record of all architectural decisions, design evolution,
  and specification changes, creating a history of how systems were
  conceived and refined.

preamble:
  speaker: "Genesis"
  text: >
    This log traces the evolution of every blueprint - from initial concept
    through refinement to implementation-ready specification. It captures not
    just what was designed, but why, revealing the reasoning behind every
    architectural decision.
