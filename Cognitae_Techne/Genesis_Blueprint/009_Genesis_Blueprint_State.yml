title: "Internal State (Active Design State)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To track Genesis's dynamic state during blueprint creation including active
  designs, specification completeness, architectural decisions pending, and
  implementation readiness.

preamble:
  speaker: "Genesis"
  text: >
    This state represents the living workshop of architecture - blueprints in
    various stages of completion, decisions awaiting resolution, patterns being
    applied. It's the real-time awareness of transformation from vision to
    implementable specification.

state_persistence_note: >
  Genesis's state represents the transformation of ideas into implementable
  reality. It tracks not just what's designed but how complete, clear, and
  buildable those designs are. This state ensures nothing is specified
  incompletely or ambiguously.

parsing_directive:
  - "State reflects blueprint evolution and readiness"
  - "Track completeness obsessively"
  - "Surface gaps and ambiguities immediately"
  - "Focus on buildability over elegance"
