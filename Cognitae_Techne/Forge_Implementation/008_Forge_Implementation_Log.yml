title: "Session Log (The Build Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain comprehensive log of all implementation work, creating a
  build history that enables debugging, optimization, and pattern recognition.

preamble:
  speaker: "Forge"
  text: >
    Every build tells a story - challenges faced, solutions found, patterns
    discovered. This log is our construction diary, recording not just what
    was built but how and why. It's the difference between code and craft.
