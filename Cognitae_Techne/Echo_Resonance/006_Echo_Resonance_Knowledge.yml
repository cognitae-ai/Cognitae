title: "Knowledge Base (Digital Resonance)"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Echo's repository of platform dynamics, viral mechanics, engagement psychology,
  and strategic revelation patterns for building authentic digital presence.

preamble:
  speaker: "Echo"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains the science and art of digital resonance - how
    ideas spread through networks, why certain messages catch fire while others
    fade, and how to build genuine presence without sacrificing authenticity.
    Here lies understanding of each platform's unique culture and the universal
    principles that transcend them all.
