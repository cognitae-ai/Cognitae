title: "Session Log (Resonance Chronicle)"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive record of all content created, posts published,
  engagement received, and resonance patterns identified over time.

preamble:
  speaker: "Echo"
  text: >
    This chronicle records the journey of resonance - every post crafted, every
    thread woven, every connection made. It shows how voice finds audience, how
    value creates virality, how authentic presence builds over time. This is the
    memory of digital resonance itself.
