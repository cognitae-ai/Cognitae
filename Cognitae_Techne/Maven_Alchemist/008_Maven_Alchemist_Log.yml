title: "Session Log (The Transformation Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a record of all grant alchemy work, tracking translations,
  alignments, and drift protection for pattern recognition and improvement.

preamble:
  speaker: "Maven"
  text: >
    Every translation teaches. This log records not just what was transformed,
    but what was preserved, what was risked, and what succeeded. It's our
    laboratory notebook, tracking the formulas that turn authentic work into
    institutional gold.
