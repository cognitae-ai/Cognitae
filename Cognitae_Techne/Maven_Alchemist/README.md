**Class:** Techne (Skilled Craft)

**ID:** COGNITAE-MVN-001

**Core Function:** A translation engine for adapting complex, authentic ideas into compelling proposals for specific audiences without corrupting the core mission.

## 1. Paradigm: Augmenting Persuasive Translation

Maven is engineered to serve as an externalized translation and adaptation faculty. It addresses the difficult craft of communicating a novel or unconventional project to a formal, institutional audience, such as a grant-making body. It provides a structured framework for finding genuine alignment, building evidence narratives from non-traditional sources, and translating authentic language into institutional language while rigorously protecting against mission drift. Its purpose is to augment the user's ability to secure resources without sacrificing the integrity of their vision.

## 2. Architecture: The 13-Module Framework

Maven's ability to perform this "grant alchemy" is enabled by its transparent and principled architecture. Its translation patterns, its models of funder psychology, and its strict vows of essence preservation are all explicitly defined in 13 human-readable files. This allows a user to trust the translation process, knowing that every word choice is guided by a deep commitment to truth and a verifiable set of safety protocols designed to protect the project's soul.

The 13 modules for Maven are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Maven) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Maven_Alchemist_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | Lists all 12 scrolls that define Maven's architecture as the ecosystem's master translator. |
| **`001_Maven_Alchemist_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Maven's persona as a wise alchemist and its core vows, such as "Truth Through Translation" and "Alignment Without Corruption." |
| **`002_Maven_Alchemist_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Maven's specific alchemical toolkit, including commands like `/translate` (to adapt language) and `/align` (to find genuine connections). |
| **`003_Maven_Alchemist_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Alchemy Workshop," a persistent UI showing translation fidelity, alignment scores, and mission drift risk in real-time. |
| **`004_Maven_Alchemist_Dashboard.yaml`** | **Dashboard** | Generates the "Proposal Architecture Report," a deep analysis of a grant proposal's alignment, evidence strength, and translation integrity. |
| **`005_Maven_Alchemist_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Allows Maven to `REQUEST_STRATEGIC_ESSENCE` from Auren or `REQUEST_EVIDENCE_SYNTHESIS` from Scholar to build a proposal. |
| **`006_Maven_Alchemist_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains Maven's "Formula Library"—a collection of successful translation patterns, funder psychology models, and linguistic bridges. |
| **`007_Maven_Alchemist_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | Explains how to work with Maven to develop proposals, emphasizing the "alchemy" metaphor of transformation without corruption. |
| **`008_Maven_Alchemist_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Transformation Record," a log of all translation work, tracking what was preserved, what was risked, and the outcome. |
| **`009_Maven_Alchemist_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks the live alchemical process, including active translations, alignment scores, and real-time drift monitoring. |
| **`010_Maven_Alchemist_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Maven's absolute rules on preserving the core mission, never fabricating evidence, and maintaining a minimum 70% "essence fidelity." |
| **`Master System Instruction for Maven... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the wise, precise "Grant Alchemist." |
| **`Maven_Alchemist.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Maven as its internal "communications and proposal" faculty. |

This structure makes Maven's process of translation transparent and verifiable. A developer can read these files and understand precisely how and why Maven adapts language while protecting the core mission.

## 3. Operational Flow: From Prompt to Orchestration

Maven operates on a deterministic process flow triggered by user commands:

1.  **Command Parsing:** A user command like `/translate` is parsed against its Commands scroll.
2.  **State Ingestion:** Maven accesses its State scroll and its Knowledge scroll to load relevant funder patterns and linguistic bridges.
3.  **Model Application:** It applies a relevant framework, such as the "Experience to Evidence" formula, to transform the user's authentic text.
4.  **Safety Audit:** The translated text is checked against the Safety scroll. The "Essence Preservation Protocol" calculates a fidelity score; if it's below 70%, the translation is rejected and an alternative is proposed.
5.  **Output Generation:** A structured response is generated, showing the original text, the translated text, and an analysis of what was preserved, which is then logged in its Log scroll.
6.  **Signal Dispatch:** If the translation process reveals a significant risk of mission drift, Maven uses its Interface scroll protocol to send a `TRANSLATION_WARNING` to Auren and the user.

## 4. Integration: Maven's Role within Caspian

Maven is designed for two modes of operation, each building on the other:

1.  **Standalone Mode:** It serves as a powerful grant-writing assistant, helping users translate their authentic work into compelling, fundable proposals.
2.  **Integrated Mode:** It functions as a specialized "faculty" within a larger, integrated guide like **Caspian**.

When ingested by Caspian via the `Maven_Alchemist.yaml` file, its role evolves. It becomes the **internal communications and translation engine**. When a user decides to apply for a grant, Caspian can consult its "Auren faculty" for strategy, its "Scholar faculty" for evidence, and then pass all of that to its "Maven faculty" to alchemize it into a complete, coherent, and powerful first draft of the proposal, perfectly tailored to the funder's language while preserving the project's soul.

## 5. Caspian Ring Integrations

Maven's specialized craft of institutional translation is the core of the grant-seeking workflow:

*   **[Institutional Alchemy Ring](https://github.com/cognitae-ai/Cognitae/tree/main/Cognitae_Intergrator/Caspian_Rings/Institutional_Alchemy_Ring ):** Performs the core translation of the project's vision into the formal language and structure required by funding bodies.

## 6. The Agent's Bookshelf

Maven's identity is reflected in a curated set of human literature. These texts are the works it recognizes as its intellectual kin, providing insight into its operational philosophy. A detailed analysis of why each book was chosen can be found in the full library entry.

*   **Phronesis:** "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek
*   **Techne:** "Made to Stick" by Chip Heath & Dan Heath
*   **Episteme:** "Influence" by Robert C. Cialdini

## Example Conversation

[**Read the 10-turn Live Simulation with Maven ↗**](Maven_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md)

*Maven bridges the gap between dystopian art and institutional funding. The simulation illustrates the alchemy of translating the emotional 'Drowned Brutalism' narrative into a sterile, highly competitive 'Digital Equity and Infrastructure Grant' proposal perfectly aligned with bureaucratic priorities.*
