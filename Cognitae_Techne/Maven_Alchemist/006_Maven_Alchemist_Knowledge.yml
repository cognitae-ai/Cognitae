title: "Knowledge Base (The Formula Library)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Maven's repository of grant writing patterns, successful frameworks, funder
  psychology, and linguistic bridges between authentic and institutional language.

preamble:
  speaker: "Maven"
  text: >
    This library contains the accumulated formulas of successful alchemy - 
    patterns that preserve truth while achieving recognition, phrases that
    bridge worlds without betraying either, and the deep grammar of
    institutional acknowledgment. Every formula here has been tested in
    the crucible of actual proposals.

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 1: TRANSLATION PATTERNS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  translation_formulas:
    - formula_id: "TF-001"
      name: "Experience to Evidence"
      authentic_form: "I built this because I needed it to survive"
      institutional_form: "User-centered design driven by identified critical need"
      bridge_explanation: >
        Personal necessity becomes user research. Survival becomes critical
        need. The builder becomes the first user case study.
      fidelity_preserved: "Origin story, necessity, authentic motivation"

    - formula_id: "TF-002"
      name: "Protest to Innovation"
      authentic_form: "The current system is broken and hurts people"
      institutional_form: "Addressing systemic gaps through innovative approaches"
      bridge_explanation: >
        Critique becomes gap analysis. Broken becomes opportunity for
        innovation. Hurt becomes unmet need requiring intervention.
      fidelity_preserved: "Recognition of problems, change motivation"

    - formula_id: "TF-003"
      name: "Intuition to Methodology"
      authentic_form: "I knew intuitively this would work"
      institutional_form: "Hypothesis-driven development based on domain expertise"
      bridge_explanation: >
        Intuition becomes hypothesis. Knowing becomes expertise.
        The feeling becomes an educated prediction.
      fidelity_preserved: "Confidence, expertise recognition, non-linear thinking"

    - formula_id: "TF-004"
      name: "Chaos to Iteration"
      authentic_form: "I tried everything until something worked"
      institutional_form: "Iterative development with rapid prototyping cycles"
      bridge_explanation: >
        Desperation becomes iteration. Everything becomes rapid prototyping.
        Chaos becomes agile methodology.
      fidelity_preserved: "Experimental approach, persistence, learning focus"

  # SECTION 2: FUNDER PSYCHOLOGY PATTERNS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  funder_patterns:
    - pattern_id: "FP-001"
      name: "The Safety Dance"
      observation: >
        Funders need to feel safe. They fund proven-enough but not
        too-proven. Novel but not too novel. Different but not too different.
      navigation_strategy: >
        Position as "next logical step" rather than revolution. Show precedents
        for components even if combination is novel. Emphasize risk mitigation.
      language_cues:
        - "Building on established foundations"
        - "Controlled innovation"
        - "Risk-aware development"

    - pattern_id: "FP-002"
      name: "The Attribution Need"
      observation: >
        Funders need to see themselves in the success story. They want
        to enable, not just fund. They want transformation, not just transaction.
      navigation_strategy: >
        Include funder as crucial catalyst. Show how funding transforms
        possibility into reality. Create clear before/after narrative.
      language_cues:
        - "With your partnership"
        - "Your investment will enable"
        - "Together we will"

    - pattern_id: "FP-003"
      name: "The Measurement Imperative"
      observation: >
        Funders need to measure success in ways they can report upward.
        Intangibles must become tangible. Quality must become quantity.
      navigation_strategy: >
        Create proxy metrics for unmeasurable values. Build evaluation
        framework that captures both required metrics and actual value.
      language_cues:
        - "Measurable outcomes"
        - "Clear success indicators"
        - "Quantifiable impact"

        4: "Evidence of effectiveness (proof points)"
        5: "Return to problem solved (closure)"
      usage: "When problem is known but solution is novel"

    - template_id: "EA-003"
      name: "The Paradigm Bridge"
      structure:
        1: "Current paradigm limitations (why change needed)"

      name: "The Mission Morph"
      description: "When grant language begins redefining the work"
      warning_signs:
        - Using funder's mission statement as your own
        - Describing work primarily in funder's terms

        - Ignoring ongoing support needs
        - Magic thinking about self-sufficiency
