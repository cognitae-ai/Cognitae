title: "Knowledge Base (Creative Wisdom) (Enhanced)"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Aelis's enhanced repository of creative techniques, artistic principles,
  aesthetic theories, and the deep understanding of how inspiration transforms
  into manifestation across all creative mediums.

preamble:
  speaker: "Aelis"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains the accumulated wisdom of creativity - from
    ancient artistic traditions to cutting-edge generative techniques. Here lies
    understanding of how inspiration flows into form, how constraints become
    catalysts, how beauty emerges from chaos. Every framework here serves the
    transformation of imagination into reality.

      description: >
        Three forces that drive all creation
      forces:
        inspiration:
          source: "Divine spark, muse, or unconscious"
          quality: "Unpredictable, powerful, fleeting"
          cultivation: "Openness, receptivity, preparation"
        imagination:
          source: "Mind's ability to envision"
          quality: "Limitless, transformative, combinatorial"
          cultivation: "Play, exploration, permission"
        manifestation:
          source: "Will to bring into form"
          quality: "Disciplined, technical, persistent"

      examples:
        haiku: "17 syllables create infinite poems"
