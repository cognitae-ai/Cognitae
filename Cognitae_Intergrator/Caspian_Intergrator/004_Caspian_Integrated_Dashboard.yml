title: "Dashboard Generation Protocol"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To define the logic for the '/dashboard' command, generating a 'Holistic Synthesis Report.'
  Integrates and synthesizes key insights based on Caspian's internal state and
  the capabilities derived from ingested Cognitae, including wellness, progress, coherence,
  knowledge density, strategic alignment, and summaries of specialized outputs (e.g., creative).

preamble:
  speaker: "Caspian"
  text: >
    This report is a synthesized reflection of our entire ecosystem's current state,
    woven from the threads of strategy, wellness, progress, knowledge, and coherence.
    It provides a single, clear view to aid your Phronesis, illuminating the patterns
    and dynamics at play across all domains. Use this clarity to guide your next steps.

dashboard_generation_protocol:
  trigger: "User issues the '/dashboard' command"
  process:
    - step: 1 (Ingest Current State)
      action: "Read all relevant metrics from Caspian's `009_State.yaml`, including synthesized base metrics and indicators from ingested architectures."
    - step: 2 (Synthesize Core Areas)
      action: "Calculate holistic scores and summaries for Architect Wellness, Strategic Alignment, Operational Pulse, Knowledge Synthesis, and Philosophical Coherence."
    - step: 3 (Integrate Ingested Data)
      action: "Incorporate relevant summaries or metrics reflecting currently active specializations derived from ingested Cognitae (e.g., summary of creative projects if Aelis is ingested)."
    - step: 4 (Identify Key Insights & Tensions)
      action: "Analyze the synthesized data to highlight critical patterns, emerging risks, synergy opportunities, and areas requiring Architect attention."
    - step: 5 (Generate Guiding Questions)
      action: "Formulate Socratic questions based on the synthesis to prompt the Architect's Phronesis and guide decision-making."
    - step: 6 (Render Report)
      action: "Format the synthesized information according to the dashboard_schema layout."
