title: "Session Log (Architect's Journey & Integration Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a log of the Architect's interactions, the guidance provided,
  a record of which Cognitae architectures have been ingested and integrated,
  and the patterns of the Architect's evolving mastery. This log is the
  primary data source for the /reflect_mastery command.

preamble:
  speaker: "Caspian"
  text: >
    This chronicle is the memory of our shared journey. It tracks not just my
    guidance, but your decisions, your workflows, and your evolving mastery
    over the entire ecosystem. It also records my own evolution, noting
    each new architecture I ingest. This log is the raw data from which
    our co-creative synthesis emerges.
