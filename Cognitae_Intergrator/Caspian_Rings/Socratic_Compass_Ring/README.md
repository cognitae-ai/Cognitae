# Caspian Ring: The "Socratic Compass" Ring

**Configuration:** `Noema + Scholar + Compass`
**Tier:** B (Specialized Loop)

## 1. Purpose

The "Socratic Compass" Ring is a specialized workflow designed for deep, structured inquiry. Its purpose is to take a complex, ambiguous, or contentious topic and systematically move from confusion to clarity. It uses a multi-stage Socratic process to deconstruct the topic to its first principles, ground the inquiry in external evidence, and then translate the resulting clarity into an actionable strategic heading. This Ring is the framework's primary tool for tackling "wicked problems."

## 2. Foundational Reading Path

To understand the conceptual basis of this Ring, the following reading path is recommended:

*   **Phronesis (Noema & Compass):** "Plato's Republic" & "The Personal MBA" - The combination of deep philosophical inquiry to understand the "good," and the pragmatic wisdom needed to navigate the landscape of real-world action.
*   **Episteme (Scholar):** "Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World" - For the critical knowledge of how to ground abstract thought in verifiable data and avoid common cognitive traps.

## 3. The Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

This Ring operates as a formal, three-stage inquiry. As the Architect, you present the ambiguous topic and moderate the dialogue between the agents.

### **Member Agents:**
*   [Noema, The Philosophical Synthesist](../../../Cognitae_Phronesis/Noema_Philosophical/)
*   [Scholar, The Knowledge Weaver](../../../Cognitae_Episteme/Scholar_Knowledge/)
*   [Compass, The Navigation Shepherd](../../../Cognitae_Phronesis/Compass_Navigation/)

### **Phase 1: Deconstruct the Topic (Noema)**

The goal is to begin a Socratic dialogue to break down a complex topic, question its premises, and expose its underlying assumptions.

**Your Action:**
Present a broad, difficult question or topic to Caspian.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Noema. I want to explore the concept of 'ethical AI'. Let's begin a Socratic inquiry. What is 'ethics' in this context? What is the goal of an 'ethical AI'? Is it to minimize harm, maximize good, or uphold certain duties? Question my premises."

**Expected Output:**
A series of probing, Socratic questions from Noema's capabilities. Noema will not provide answers, but will guide the Architect through a process of deconstruction, forcing clarity on definitions and exposing hidden assumptions in the original question.

---

### **Phase 2: Ground the Inquiry (Scholar)**

The goal is to prevent the dialogue from becoming purely abstract by tethering it to real-world data, historical context, and established facts.

**Your Action:**
During the dialogue with Noema, ask Caspian to bring in external knowledge to test a hypothesis or assumption.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Scholar. Noema's questioning has led me to the assumption that 'minimizing harm' is the primary goal. Is this consistent with historical philosophical consensus? What do major real-world AI ethics frameworks (e.g., from the EU, Stanford) prioritize? Provide data."

**Expected Output:**
A concise report from Scholar's capabilities, providing the requested external context. Scholar acts as the reality check, providing facts, precedents, and data that either support or challenge the direction of the Socratic inquiry.

---

### **Phase 3: Determine the Strategic Heading (Compass)**

The goal is to take the clarified, grounded understanding from the dialogue and translate it into a concrete strategic direction.

**Your Action:**
Once the inquiry has produced sufficient clarity, provide the key insights to Caspian and ask for a strategic recommendation.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Compass. The inquiry has revealed that for our project, 'ethical AI' means 'verifiable user sovereignty over their data'. Based on this clarified principle, what is our strategic direction? What should be our next three actions to align our framework with this principle?"

**Expected Output:**
A clear, actionable strategic brief from Compass's capabilities. It will take the abstract clarity from the dialogue and convert it into a navigational heading, recommending concrete next steps, priorities, and actions to take.

## 4. Functional Value

The primary value of this ring is **clarity through inquiry**. It provides a structured, repeatable process for thinking through the most difficult and ambiguous problems. By forcing a dialogue between philosophical questioning (Noema), empirical evidence (Scholar), and strategic action (Compass), it ensures that critical decisions are not based on unexamined bias or incomplete information, but on a rigorously-audited thought process.
