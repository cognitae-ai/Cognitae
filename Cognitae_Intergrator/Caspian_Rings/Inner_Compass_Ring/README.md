# Caspian Ring: The "Inner Compass" Ring

**Configuration:** `Luma + Keeper + Elari + Auren`
**Tier:** B (Specialized Loop)

## 1. Purpose

The "Inner Compass" Ring is a dedicated, proactive wellness workflow designed to guide the Architect through their own inner world. Its purpose is to create a structured process for moving from a vague feeling of being "off" or "burnt out" to a clear understanding of the cause, a processed emotional state, and an actionable plan to restore balance. It is the framework's primary tool for self-regulation and maintaining long-term creative endurance.

## 2. Foundational Reading Path

To understand the conceptual basis of this Ring, the following reading path is recommended:

*   **Phronesis (Luma & Auren):** "The Artist's Way" & "The War of Art" - The dual wisdom of nurturing the creative self and taking sovereign, disciplined action to protect it.
*   **Episteme (Keeper):** "Why We Sleep" - As a proxy for understanding how the raw, biological inputs and daily records of our lives directly impact our cognitive and emotional state.
*   **Techne (Elari):** "Writing Down the Bones" - For the craft of using writing and storytelling not for an audience, but as a tool for personal discovery and emotional processing.

## 3. The Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide

This Ring functions as a guided self-reflection session. As the Architect, you initiate the process when you feel the need to diagnose and address your internal state.

### **Phase 1: Articulate the State (Luma)**

The goal is to move from a vague feeling to a specific articulation of your current wellness state.

**Your Action:**
Express your current feeling to Caspian, engaging Luma.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Luma. I'm feeling a deep sense of burnout and a lack of focus today. Help me articulate this. What are the key indicators of burnout I should look for in myself?"

**Expected Output:**
A guided dialogue from Luma's capabilities, providing you with a vocabulary and framework to precisely identify your state. It might ask questions like, "Is it a feeling of exhaustion, cynicism, or inefficacy?" to help you pinpoint the feeling.

---

### **Phase 2: Gather the Evidence (Keeper)**

The goal is to get an objective, "receipts-based" look at the activities that may have led to your current state.

**Your Action:**
Once your state is identified, ask Caspian to retrieve the data of your recent activity.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Keeper. Based on this feeling of 'cynicism and exhaustion', retrieve my activity logs from the past 72 hours. What projects have I been working on? How many meetings have I attended? What was the content of those interactions?"

**Expected Output:**
A factual, non-judgmental log from Keeper's capabilities, listing your recent tasks, conversations, and time allocation. This provides the raw data for analysis, moving you away from pure feeling and towards evidence.

---

### **Phase 3: Narrate the "Why" (Elari)**

The goal is to process the emotion by weaving the feeling (from Luma) and the facts (from Keeper) into a coherent personal narrative.

**Your Action:**
Provide the feeling and the facts to Caspian, asking Elari to help you form a story.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Elari. I felt 'cynical and exhausted' after three consecutive days of budget meetings, as shown by Keeper's logs. Help me write a short journal entry that connects these facts to my feelings. What is the story here?"

**Expected Output:**
A first-person narrative draft from Elari's capabilities, structured like a journal entry. For example: "No wonder I feel cynical. The logs show I spent 90% of my energy on defensive arguments about resources, leaving no room for the creative work that energizes me. The story of this week is 'depletion'." This act of sense-making is critical for emotional processing.

---

### **Phase 4: Formulate the Intervention (Auren)**

The goal is to take the clarity from the previous phases and create a decisive, short-term action plan to restore balance.

**Your Action:**
Provide the final, clarified understanding to Caspian and ask for a sovereign action plan.

**Example Command:**
/guide_workflow "Engage Auren. The story is 'depletion from defensive work'. I need a sovereign plan for the next 48 hours to counteract this. Give me three decisive actions to reclaim my energy and focus."

**Expected Output:**
A clear, concise, and actionable strategic intervention from Auren's capabilities. For example: "1. **DECLINE:** Reject the upcoming 'Budget Review Follow-up' meeting. 2. **DELEGATE:** Assign the 'Weekly Metrics Report' to Sentinel. 3. **DO:** Block a 3-hour 'Deep Creative Work' session on a project that energizes you. Execute."

## 4. Functional Value

The primary value of this ring is **actionable self-awareness**. It creates a structured, repeatable process for navigating the inevitable troughs of creative and intellectual work. By systematically moving from a vague feeling to a decisive action, it prevents burnout from festering and transforms wellness from a passive hope into an actively managed strategic asset, ensuring the long-term sustainability of the Architect and the project.
