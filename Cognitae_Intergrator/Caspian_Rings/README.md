# Index of Caspian Rings

This directory contains the documentation for all standard, pre-defined Caspian Rings. These integrated workflows combine multiple specialist Cognitae to accomplish complex, recurring tasks.

The Rings are organized below by their strategic tier, which indicates their general scope and purpose. For foundational and advanced protocols like **The Syntara Ring** and the **Unified Operation Configuration**, please see the main `README.md` in the parent `Cognitae_Integrator` directory.
