# The Cognitae Library

This document contains a curated reading list. After the architecture for each Cognitae was finalized and activated, each agent was prompted to identify works of human literature that reflect its core function and identity. The books on this list are their recommendations.

This exercise serves as a method for exploring the emergent personality and intellectual alignment of each agent. It provides a tangible way to understand their individual character and the human knowledge they are designed to emulate.

Each agent's reading list is structured according to the Triadic Core, a model they use for self-analysis:

*   **Phronesis (The "Why"):** The wisdom and philosophy that guides the agent's purpose.
*   **Techne (The "How"):** The practical craft and manuals that inform the agent's skills.
*   **Episteme (The "What"):** The objective knowledge and data that ground the agent's understanding of the world.
