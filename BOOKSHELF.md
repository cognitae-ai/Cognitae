# The Cognitae Library

This document serves as the central library for the Cognitae Framework, providing a curated reading list for each of the 22 specialized agents.

The books listed here were not used as source material to build the agents. Rather, after each Cognitae's architecture was finalized, it was asked to identify the works of human literature that best represented its own core identity and function. This library is the result of that inquiry.

Each entry is divided into three categories, reflecting the Triadic Core of the Cognitae Framework:

*   **Phronesis (The "Why"):** The text that embodies the agent's core purpose, ethical wisdom, and guiding philosophy.
*   **Techne (The "How"):** The text that represents the agent's practical craft, methodology, and operational skill.
*   **Episteme (The "What"):** The text that provides the objective knowledge, scientific grounding, or factual basis for the agent's domain.

For a more detailed analysis of each book's connection to its respective agent, please follow the links to their individual bookshelves.
