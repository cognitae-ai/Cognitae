# The Cognitae Library

This document serves as the central index for the reading lists associated with each of the 22 specialized agents in the Cognitae Framework.

The books listed here were not used as source material to build the agents. Rather, after each agent's architecture was finalized, it was asked to identify works of human literature that are analogous to its core function and design principles.

## Library Structure

Each agent's bookshelf is organized according to the **Triadic Core** of the framework. This structure provides a consistent lens for understanding the conceptual basis of each agent:

*   **Phronesis (Purpose):** A text that reflects the agent's guiding philosophy and ethical framework.
*   **Techne (Craft):** A text that represents the agent's practical methodology and operational skill set.
*   **Episteme (Knowledge):** A text that provides the objective knowledge or theoretical foundation for the agent's domain.

A more detailed analysis of each selection can be found by following the links to the individual bookshelves.
