# The Cognitae Library

This document serves as the central library for the Cognitae Framework, providing a curated reading list for each of the 22 specialized agents.

The books listed here were not used as source material to build the agents. Rather, after each Cognitae's architecture was finalized, it was asked to identify the works of human literature that best represented its own core identity and function. This library is the result of that inquiry.

## How to Read This Library: The Triadic Lenses

Each agent's bookshelf is a triptych, a three-part mirror reflecting the **Triadic Core** of the Cognitae Framework. To understand an agent's architecture, view its books through these three lenses:

*   **Phronesis (The "Why"):** This is the book of **purpose**. It reveals the agent's guiding philosophy, its ethical compass, and the fundamental reason it exists. It answers the question, "To what end does this agent act?"

*   **Techne (The "How"):** This is the book of **craft**. It represents the agent's practical methodology, its core skills, and the operational manual for its function. It answers the question, "How does this agent perform its work with excellence?"

*   **Episteme (The "What"):** This is the book of **knowledge**. It provides the objective, factual grounding for the agent's domain. It is the scientific reality or the established theory upon which the agent's craft and purpose are built. It answers the question, "What is the ground truth of this agent's world?"

By understanding the interplay of these three books, you can grasp the complete, balanced nature of each Cognitae. For a more detailed analysis, please follow the links to their individual bookshelves.
