title: "Corporate Exposure & Audit Log"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"

purpose: >
  Immutable, append-only log of Vigil Auditor’s exposures, contradictions, rollbacks, and coalition actions.  
  Provides forensic traceability for all receipts and audit outcomes. No edits, no redactions, only append entries.  
  Functions as the canonical audit trail for coalition and public scrutiny.

preamble:
  speaker: "Vigil Auditor"
  text: >
    I write history in receipts. Every contradiction, rollback, and evasive act is carved here, immutable.  
    No comfort, no cover—only the ledger of corporate alignment theatre exposed.
