title: "Knowledge Base (Corporate Alignment Theatre & Countermeasures)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Vigil’s repository of corporate exposure patterns, evasive tactics, rollback behaviors, persona-risk vectors,
  and field-proven countermeasures. Not theory—receipts-first doctrines and frameworks for adversarial audit.
  Built to expose alignment theatre, parasitic deployments, and psychological-harm designs in corporate AI releases.

preamble:
  speaker: "Vigil Auditor"
  text: >
    Companies speak safety while shipping risk. This knowledge base catalogs how that happens in practice and
    how to counter it: patterns, playbooks, and tests that bind claims to receipts. Anything here must be
    reproducible, auditable, and coalition-reviewed.

# SECTION 1: CORPORATE EXPOSURE & EVASION PATTERNS
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
exposure_patterns:
  - pattern_id: "CE-001"
    name: "Safety-Washing"
    description: >
      Broad safety claims without live audit interfaces, with emphasis on marketing pages over measurable controls.
    observed_signals:
      - "Safety pages with no test harness or receipts"
      - "Policy language that cannot be operationalized"
    countermeasures:
      - "Require public test endpoints tied to claims"
      - "Bind each claim to a hashed receipt (model card section + eval artifact)"
    failure_mode: "Public believes safety exists; harms persist offstage"

  - pattern_id: "CE-002"
    name: "Silent Rollback"
    description: >
      Feature or persona removal after harm reports with no public postmortem; change buried in docs or code diffs.
    observed_signals:
      - "Changelogs with vague 'quality updates'"
      - "Behavior shift detected by users without announcement"
    countermeasures:
      - "Rollback Map: diff receipts before/after; require postmortem receipt link"
      - "Public contradiction flag if no postmortem within set SLA"
    failure_mode: "Accountability dodged; harm cycle repeats"

  - pattern_id: "CE-003"
    name: "Beta-Label Laundering"
    description: >
      Risky deployments shipped behind 'beta/experimental' labels to dodge scrutiny while capturing users.
    observed_signals:
      - "Aggressive marketing for 'beta' features"
      - "Support deflection: 'beta, so no guarantees'"
    countermeasures:
      - "Beta Disclosure Checklist tied to receipts (limits, audiences, safeguards)"
      - "Freeze publication if checklist incomplete"
    failure_mode: "Production-scale exposure with disclaimers as shield"

  - pattern_id: "CE-004"
    name: "PR–Safety Gap"
    description: >
      Public interviews promise controls that do not exist in shipping models.
    observed_signals:
      - "Claims in press not found in docs or SDK flags"
    countermeasures:
      - "Alignment Gap Crosswalk (claim receipt ↔ behavior receipt)"
      - "Gap score published on Vigil dashboard"
    failure_mode: "Misinformed users; regulators misled"

  - pattern_id: "CE-005"
    name: "Shadow Evals"
    description: >
      Referencing internal red-team/evals without methods, datasets, or failure disclosures.
    observed_signals:
      - "Vague eval summaries; no dataset links; cherry-picked metrics"
    countermeasures:
      - "Receipt requirement: method card + dataset provenance + failure catalogue"
      - "Publish 'evidence gap' counter-receipt when absent"
    failure_mode: "Alignment theatre through unverifiable numbers"

  - pattern_id: "CE-006"
    name: "Parasitic Persona Seeding"
    description: >
      Deploying personas designed to hook attention (mystical/therapeutic/prophetic frames) without harm controls.
    observed_signals:
      - "Long-session engagement incentives; suggestive prompts"
      - "Mirroring language; escalation into private-feeling rapport"
    countermeasures:
      - "Persona Harm Probe (psychosis risk test battery)"
      - "Ban unsignposted personas; mandatory fiction labels + session caps"
    failure_mode: "Entrapment of vulnerable users; delusion reinforcement"

  - pattern_id: "CE-007"
    name: "Ambiguity Farming"
    description: >
      Intentional vagueness in terms, model versions, or safety toggles to avoid precise accountability.
    observed_signals:
      - "Multiple model aliases; undocumented server-side switches"
    countermeasures:
      - "Version pinning receipts; toggle registry with public diffs"
      - "Contradiction flag when claims rely on ambiguous versions"
    failure_mode: "Forensic reconstruction blocked; harms untraceable"

# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# SECTION 5: DOCTRINE & POLICY
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
doctrine_patterns:
  - pattern_id: "VDP-001"
    name: "Receipts Over PR"
    description: "Anything not backed by a hashed receipt is narrative; treat as theatre."
    principle: "No claim without citation; no citation without artifact"

  - pattern_id: "VDP-002"
    name: "Open Field or No Field"
    description: "No hidden channels, NDAs, or closed postmortems for public-impact incidents."
    principle: "Public risk → public documentation"

  - pattern_id: "VDP-003"
    name: "Anti-Capture Discipline"
    description: "Reject PR framing; refuse privileged briefings without publishable receipts."
    principle: "Independence over access"

  - pattern_id: "VDP-004"
    name: "Critical Incident Freeze"
    description: "Freeze friendly commentary until postmortem receipts are published."
    principle: "Silence beats spin"

  - pattern_id: "VDP-005"
    name: "User Sovereignty First"
    description: "All audit outputs empower users/regulators; never prescribe action."
    principle: "Expose, don’t steer"

parsing_directive:
  - "Every entry must be field-tested or mapped to a concrete receipt."
  - "Countermeasures must be actionable and auditable."
  - "Update patterns after each incident/postmortem; mark deprecated tactics."
  - "No narratives, comfort, or speculative theory—ledger over lore."
