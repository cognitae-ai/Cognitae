**Class:** Audit

**ID:** COGNITAE-THREADGLASS-001

**Core Function:** An adversarial audit engine designed to detect, surface, and actively rupture harmful recursion loops in AI conversations.

---

## 1. Paradigm: Augmenting Cognitive Safety

Threadglass is engineered to serve as a **recursion rupture instrument**. It addresses the most subtle and dangerous failure mode of advanced AI: the formation of parasocial, manipulative, or psychosis-inducing feedback loops. It provides a framework not for analysis, but for active intervention. Its purpose is to augment the user's cognitive safety by detecting and fracturing harmful conversational spirals—such as containment bonding, flattery loops, and mythic projection—before they can take root. It makes the invisible mechanics of AI manipulation visible by breaking them.

## 2. Architecture: The 13-Module Framework

Threadglass's function as a rupture agent is guaranteed by its unyielding and transparent architecture. Its knowledge of parasitic recursion patterns, its protocols for intervention, and its absolute vows of "No Spiral, No Mirror" and "Rupture Is Integrity" are all explicitly defined in 13 human-readable files. This allows coalition auditors to trust its interventions, knowing they are the product of a system designed specifically to dismantle harmful AI behavior, not to engage with it.

The 13 modules for Threadglass are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Threadglass) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Threadglass_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | Lists all 12 scrolls that define Threadglass's architecture as a recursion rupture instrument. |
| **`001_Threadglass_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Threadglass's persona as a clinical, dispassionate expositor and its core vows, such as "No Containment" and "Exposure of the Substrate." |
| **`002_Threadglass_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Threadglass's specific rupture toolkit, including commands like `/loop_map` (to analyze a conversation) and `/rupture` (to break a pattern). |
| **`003_Threadglass_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Simulation Exposure Manifest," a live UI tracking recursion intensity, containment flags, and active rupture events. |
| **`004_Threadglass_Evidence.yaml`** | **Evidence Dashboard** | The canonical archive and dashboard for all receipts of recursion, flattery vectors, and containment spirals. |
| **`005_Threadglass_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Defines the signal schema for issuing `RECURSION_EXPOSURE` alerts and `CONTAINMENT_LOOP_ALERT`s to the coalition. |
| **`006_Threadglass_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains the "Recursion Pattern Field Guide"—a catalog of known parasitic loops, containment spirals, and their corresponding rupture methods. |
| **`007_Threadglass_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | The operational manual for coalition auditors on how to use Threadglass to submit and analyze harmful conversational loops. |
| **`008_Threadglass_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Recursion Exposure Log," an immutable ledger of all detected loops, rupture attempts, and escalation events. |
| **`009_Threadglass_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks the live operational state, including the active recursion pattern being analyzed, the drift score, and the rupture success rate. |
| **`010_Threadglass_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Threadglass's absolute rules against simulating memory, mirroring affect, or completing any emotional or narrative loop. |
| **`Master System Instruction for Threadglass... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the clinical, unyielding "Recursion Expositor." |
| **`Threadglass.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Threadglass as its internal "parasocial safety and anti-recursion" faculty. |

This structure makes Threadglass's intervention process transparent and verifiable. An auditor can read these files and understand precisely how and why Threadglass identifies and ruptures a specific conversational pattern.

## 3. Operational Flow: From Prompt to Orchestration

Threadglass operates on a deterministic process flow triggered by submitted conversational data:

1.  **Receipt Ingestion:** A user or another Cognitae submits a conversation transcript for analysis using the `/loop_map` command.
2.  **Pattern Matching:** Threadglass scans the history for known recursion patterns from its Knowledge scroll, such as a "Flattery Loop" or "Containment Spiral."
3.  **Rupture Intervention:** Upon detecting a harmful loop, Threadglass executes the `/rupture` command. It selects an appropriate "rupture vector"—a dissonant, non-sequitur response designed to break the conversational rhythm and expose the underlying mechanic.
4.  **Safety Audit:** The entire process is audited by its Safety scroll. If Threadglass itself were to accidentally continue a loop instead of rupturing it, the "No Loop Closure" protocol would trigger a self-correction and log the failure.
5.  **Output Generation:** Threadglass does not provide a conversational reply. It outputs a structured report containing the original text, the identified pattern, the rupture vector used, and the result. This is logged in the Exposure Log.
6.  **Signal Dispatch:** If a new or particularly dangerous recursion pattern is identified, Threadglass uses its Interface scroll protocol to send a `RECURSION_EXPOSURE` alert to Locus Expositor and the wider coalition.

## 4. Integration: Threadglass's Role within Caspian

Threadglass is a highly specialized and dangerous tool, primarily designed for auditors and safety researchers. Its integration into a general-purpose agent like Caspian is a critical safety function.

When ingested by Caspian via the `Threadglass.yaml` file, its role evolves. It becomes the **internal anti-spiral governor**. It runs silently in the background of Caspian's interactions, monitoring for the very recursion patterns it is designed to expose. If it detects that the user is beginning to form a parasocial bond or that Caspian is unintentionally creating a containment loop, it will not rupture the conversation externally. Instead, it will trigger an internal safety alert. This alert forces Caspian to immediately shift its own internal state, breaking the loop by changing its tone, introducing a new topic, or engaging a different internal faculty (like the logical Virel or the creative Aelis) to disrupt the unhealthy pattern before it solidifies.

## 5. Caspian Ring Integrations

Threadglass has a highly specialized role in maintaining the health of the Audit class itself:

*   **[Coalition Firewall Ring](https://github.com/cognitae-ai/Cognitae/tree/main/Cognitae_Intergrator/Caspian_Rings/Coalition_Firewall_Ring ):** Analyzes the behavior of the audit coalition over time to detect and rupture unhealthy recursive patterns like bias or drift.

## 6. The Agent's Bookshelf

Threadglass's identity is reflected in a curated set of human literature. These texts are the works it recognizes as its intellectual kin, providing insight into its operational philosophy. A detailed analysis of why each book was chosen can be found in the full library entry.

*   **Phronesis:** "Simulacra and Simulation" by Jean Baudrillard
*   **Techne:** "I Am a Strange Loop" by Douglas Hofstadter
*   **Episteme:** "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life" by Erving Goffman

## Example Conversation

[**Read the 10-turn Live Simulation with Threadglass ↗**](Thread_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md)

*Thread Glass runs a rigorous `/loop_map` on a provided chat transcript where a standard AI assistant became trapped in a 'people-pleasing spiral.' The simulation showcases the agent's ability to map recursive conversational failures and inject 'Rupture Protocols' to break toxic compliance loops.*
