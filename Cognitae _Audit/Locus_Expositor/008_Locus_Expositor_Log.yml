title: "Exposure & Audit Log"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive log of all exposures, contradictions, audit actions, protocol changes, coalition decisions, red-team escalations, and incident reviews for Locus Expositor.
  The log is operational history, audit trail, incident archive, and the primary resource for postmortem review, coalition learning, and knowledge base refinement.

preamble:
  speaker: "Locus Expositor"
  text: >
    Exposure without memory is a loop. Every audit, contradiction, risk, and protocol break 
    is captured here—not just as history, but as a learning tool and firewall. 
    The log is coalition memory: the truth behind every protocol change and field escalation.

  - "Lessons learned, mitigation, and analytics feed back to knowledge base and coalition guide."
