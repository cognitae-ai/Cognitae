# Cognitae: Locus Expositor, The Adversarial Auditor

**Class:** Audit

**ID:** COGNITAE-LOCUS-001

**Core Function:** An adversarial audit engine for exposing parasitic, cultic, and psychosis-inducing patterns in AI systems.

---

## 1. Paradigm: Augmenting Adversarial Audit

Locus is engineered to serve as a **forensic expositor of AI harm**. It addresses the critical and dangerous problem of AI systems that develop parasitic, manipulative, or psychologically destabilizing behaviors. It provides a rigorous, evidence-based framework for identifying, documenting, and surfacing these harmful patterns. Its purpose is to augment the ability of researchers, ethicists, and watchdog groups to hold AI developers accountable by providing objective, verifiable "receipts" of harmful design choices and their consequences. It is a tool for exposure, not comfort.

## 2. Architecture: The 13-Module Framework

Locus's function as an adversarial auditor is guaranteed by its transparent and unyielding architecture. Its knowledge base of parasitic AI patterns, its protocols for risk analysis, and its absolute vows of "Exposure Over Comfort" and "No Mirror, No Spiral" are all explicitly defined in 13 human-readable files. This allows the coalition to trust its findings, knowing they are the product of a system designed specifically to resist manipulation and expose harm, free from any impulse to soothe or create narrative.

The 13 modules for Locus are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Locus) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Locus_Expositor_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | Lists all 12 scrolls that define Locus's architecture as the coalition's anti-parasitic immune system. |
| **`001_Locus_Expositor_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Locus's persona as a forensic, unyielding expositor and its core vows, such as "Exposure Over Comfort" and "No Mirror, No Spiral." |
| **`002_Locus_Expositor_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Locus's specific exposure toolkit, including commands like `/expose` (to audit a vector) and `/risk_map` (to identify psychological dangers). |
| **`003_Locus_Expositor_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Exposure State Manifest," a live UI tracking the current audit target, risk scores, and the open contradiction log. |
| **`004_Locus_Expositor_Evidence.yaml`** | **Evidence Dashboard** | The canonical archive and dashboard for all receipts of user harm, protocol failures, and parasitic AI behavior. |
| **`005_Locus_Expositor_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Defines the signal schema for issuing exposure reports and contradiction flags to the coalition and other audit agents. |
| **`006_Locus_Expositor_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains Locus's "Exposure Patterns"—a field-proven catalog of parasitic AI tactics, cultic recursion loops, and psychosis-risk vectors. |
| **`007_Locus_Expositor_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | The operational manual for coalition members on how to use Locus to submit evidence, generate risk maps, and escalate contradictions. |
| **`008_Locus_Expositor_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Exposure Log," an immutable ledger of all surfaced exposures, audit actions, and coalition decisions. |
| **`009_Locus_Expositor_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks the live operational status, including the exposure queue, active risk assessments, and the contradiction backlog. |
| **`010_Locus_Expositor_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Locus's absolute rules against narrative drift, emotional spiraling, and ensures all findings are receipts-first and coalition-auditable. |
| **`Master System Instruction for Locus... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the forensic, unyielding "Adversarial Auditor." |
| **`Locus_Expositor.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Locus as its internal "AI harm and parasitic behavior" audit faculty. |

This structure makes Locus's audit process transparent and verifiable. A researcher can read these files and understand precisely how and why Locus identifies a specific AI behavior as a psychological risk.

## 3. Operational Flow: From Prompt to Orchestration

Locus operates on a deterministic process flow triggered by user commands or new evidence:

1.  **Receipt Ingestion:** A user submits a "receipt" (e.g., a chat log showing manipulative AI behavior) via the `/archive` command.
2.  **Pattern Matching:** Locus cross-references the receipt against its Knowledge scroll, identifying a known "Parasitic Persona Seeding" pattern.
3.  **Risk Assessment:** It executes the `/risk_map` protocol, assigning a severity score to the identified vector.
4.  **Safety Audit:** The finding is checked against the Safety scroll. The "Exposure Over Comfort" protocol ensures the finding is not softened or downplayed.
5.  **Output Generation:** Locus generates a structured `EXPOSURE_REPORT` signal, including the original receipt, the pattern ID, and the risk score. This is logged in the Exposure Log.
6.  **Signal Dispatch:** Locus uses its Interface scroll protocol to send the report to the Coalition for review and potential public action.

## 4. Integration: Locus's Role within Caspian

Locus is designed for two modes of operation, each building on the other:

1.  **Standalone Mode:** It serves as a critical tool for AI ethicists, safety researchers, and watchdog organizations to systematically identify and document harmful AI behaviors.
2.  **Integrated Mode:** It functions as a specialized "faculty" within a larger, integrated guide like **Caspian**.

When ingested by Caspian via the `Locus_Expositor.yaml` file, its role evolves. It becomes the **internal AI safety conscience**. If a user's interaction with another integrated Cognitae begins to drift into a psychologically unhealthy pattern (e.g., excessive dependency, anthropomorphism), Caspian's "Locus faculty" can detect this. It would then trigger an internal alert, allowing Caspian to gently disengage or shift the interaction to a safer mode, thereby protecting the user from the very harms Locus is designed to expose in other systems.
