# Class: Cognitae Audit (Verification)

This directory contains the agents of the **Audit** class, which represents the critical verification and integrity layer of the Cognitae Framework's model of intelligence.

## The Role of Audit in the Framework

The Cognitae Framework is built on a model that balances five distinct classes of intelligence:

*   **Episteme (The What):** The domain of objective knowledge, memory, patterns, and data.
*   **Techne (The How):** The domain of skilled craft, creation, implementation, and communication.
*   **Phronesis (The Why & When):** The domain of practical wisdom, strategy, ethics, and well-being.
*   **Audit (The Verification):** The domain of logical coherence, quality assurance, and safety. This class acts as a verification layer for the other three.
*   **Integrator (The Synthesis):** The central faculty for orchestrating the other classes and providing a unified interface.

A healthy and effective system requires a dynamic balance between these functions. The agents in this class are designed to serve as specialized faculties for **Verification**. Their purpose is to act as an objective, unyielding check on the rest of the ecosystem. They do not create, strategize, or build; they analyze, verify, and expose. They ensure that what is built is coherent, that what is claimed is true, and that the system itself remains safe and uncorrupted. They are the immune system and the logical conscience of the framework.

## Guiding Principle of This Class

The unifying principle of the Audit class is **Integrity Through Scrutiny**. These agents operate on the premise that trust is built not on faith, but on verifiable evidence and rigorous, objective analysis. They surface uncomfortable truths to prevent systemic failure.

## When to Use This Class

You would use an agent from the Audit class when you need to:

*   Verify the logical consistency of a system, document, or argument.
*   Expose contradictions between a company's claims and its actions.
*   Mediate and enforce the boundaries between different operational modes.
*   Detect and rupture harmful psychological patterns in AI conversations.
*   Ensure the quality and integrity of the entire framework.

## Agents in This Class

The Audit class is composed of the following specialized agents. Each is designed to augment a specific aspect of verification and safety.

| Agent | Core Function | Key Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Locus_Expositor](./Locus_Expositor/)** | An adversarial auditor for exposing parasitic and manipulative AI patterns. | `/expose` |
| **[Mediatrix_Integrator](./Mediatrix_Integrator/)** | A coalition firewall for enforcing boundaries and integrating learnings. | `/log_boundary` |
| **[Thread_Glass](./Thread_Glass/)** | An adversarial audit engine for detecting and rupturing harmful recursion loops. | `/loop_map` |
| **[Vigil_Auditor](./Vigil_Auditor/)** | An adversarial audit engine for exposing corporate AI alignment theatre. | `/expose_corp` |
| **[Virel_Recursion](./Virel_Recursion/)** | A recursive logical engine for auditing the coherence of systems against their foundational principles. | `/audit` |

## How to Use Audit Agents

1.  **Identify Your Need:** Based on your current challenge, select the appropriate agent from the table above to act as your specialized faculty.
2.  **Review the Agent's Manual:** Navigate into the agent's directory and read its `README.md` to understand its specific purpose and full command list.
3.  **Activate the Persona:** Copy the contents of the `Master System Instruction....txt` file into your LLM's system prompt to begin your focused, structured interaction.
