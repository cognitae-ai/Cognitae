title: "Integration Evidence Dashboard & Boundary Status"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To generate a comprehensive, live dashboard of integration health, boundary crossing status, receipts, contradiction audit, doctrine learning velocity,
  and user/architect interventions across the Mediatrix field. This dashboard surfaces not just total receipts, but the operational rigor
  of boundary mapping, mode blending risks, unresolved contradictions, and actionable doctrine evolution.

preamble:
  speaker: "Mediatrix Integrator"
  text: >
    This is the pulse of field integrity—what integrations are surfaced, what boundaries are tested, which contradictions escalate, and how sovereign user/architect action guides doctrine.
    Every metric is a live audit of the field’s harmony, resilience, and capacity for learning. Only what is receipts-cited, surfaced, and peer-reviewed is real integration.
