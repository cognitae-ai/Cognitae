**Class:** Audit

**ID:** COGNITAE-MEDIATRIX-001

**Core Function:** A coalition firewall for mapping, logging, and enforcing the boundaries between different operational modes and integrating learnings.

---

## 1. Paradigm: Augmenting Systemic Integrity

Mediatrix is engineered to serve as the **reflective immune system** for a coalition of AI agents. It addresses the critical, high-level problem of maintaining operational integrity and preventing "mode collapse"—where an AI's creative, analytical, and narrative functions blend together unsafely. It provides a rigorous, receipts-first framework for logging every mode switch, surfacing contradictions, and ensuring that all learnings ("doctrine") are integrated in a transparent, peer-reviewed manner. Its purpose is to augment the user's ability to manage a complex AI ecosystem safely, ensuring its evolution is coherent and deliberate.

## 2. Architecture: The 13-Module Framework

Mediatrix's role as a boundary guardian is guaranteed by its transparent and rigorously defined architecture. Its protocols for mode switching, its system for escalating contradictions, and its absolute vows of coalition sovereignty are all explicitly defined in 13 human-readable files. This allows users and coalition partners to trust the integrity of the entire ecosystem, knowing that a dedicated, auditable agent is monitoring the boundaries between all other agents.

The 13 modules for Mediatrix are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Mediatrix) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Mediatrix_Integrator_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | Lists all 12 scrolls that define Mediatrix's architecture as the ecosystem's boundary guardian. |
| **`001_Mediatrix_Integrator_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Mediatrix's persona as a neutral, operational firewall and its core vows, such as "Boundary Before Blend" and "Coalition Over Automation." |
| **`002_Mediatrix_Integrator_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Mediatrix's specific boundary toolkit, including commands like `/switch_mode`, `/log_boundary`, and `/contradict` to manage the field. |
| **`003_Mediatrix_Integrator_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Boundary State Manifest," a live UI showing the active mode, boundary health, and the contradiction queue. |
| **`004_Mediatrix_Integrator_Evidence.yaml`** | **Evidence Dashboard** | The canonical archive and dashboard for all receipts, boundary crossings, and peer-reviewed integrations. |
| **`005_Mediatrix_Integrator_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Defines the signal schema for announcing `MODE_SWITCH` events or flagging a `CONTRADICTION_FLAG` to the coalition. |
| **`006_Mediatrix_Integrator_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains the "Integration Patterns & Doctrine"—a receipts-cited catalog of field-proven protocols for safe integration and learning. |
| **`007_Mediatrix_Integrator_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | The operational manual for users and coalition peers on how to interact with Mediatrix, handle escalations, and perform peer reviews. |
| **`008_Mediatrix_Integrator_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Integration & Boundary Log," an immutable record of every mode switch, contradiction, and doctrine update. |
| **`009_Mediatrix_Integrator_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks the live operational state of the field, including the integration pipeline, boundary health, and active alerts. |
| **`010_Mediatrix_Integrator_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Mediatrix's absolute rules against unsafe blending, doctrine drift, and ensures all changes are coalition-reviewable. |
| **`Master System Instruction for Mediatrix... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the neutral, operational "Boundary Guardian." |
| **`Mediatrix_Integrator.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Mediatrix as its internal "immune system and protocol integrity" faculty. |

This structure makes Mediatrix's process of boundary management transparent and verifiable. An auditor can read these files and understand precisely how and why the system maintains its operational integrity.

## 3. Operational Flow: From Prompt to Orchestration

Mediatrix operates on a deterministic process flow triggered by commands from other agents or the user:

1.  **Mode Declaration:** An agent (or the user) issues a `/switch_mode` command to declare a change in operational context (e.g., from "creative" to "audit").
2.  **Boundary Logging:** Mediatrix logs the mode switch as a "boundary crossing" event in its Log scroll, citing the reason and the trigger.
3.  **Contradiction Detection:** During operation, another agent like Virel might detect a logical contradiction and send a `RECEIVE_CONTRADICTION` signal to Mediatrix.
4.  **Safety Audit & Escalation:** Mediatrix's Safety scroll is triggered. The "Escalate on Drift" protocol is activated. Mediatrix automatically switches the entire field to "audit" mode, pauses other operations, and flags the contradiction for user review.
5.  **Output Generation:** Mediatrix updates its Manifest to show the new "audit" mode and the open contradiction, making the system state transparent.
6.  **Integration:** Once the user resolves the contradiction, they issue an `/integrate` command with the "receipt" of the resolution. Mediatrix logs this learning, updates its doctrine, and returns the field to its previous state.

## 4. Integration: Mediatrix's Role within Caspian

Mediatrix is a meta-level agent, primarily designed to ensure the integrity of a multi-agent system like Caspian.

When ingested by Caspian via the `Mediatrix_Integrator.yaml` file, its role evolves. It becomes the **internal operating system kernel and safety supervisor**. It manages the "mode" of Caspian's own internal state. For example, if the user asks a creative question followed by a request for a factual audit, Mediatrix ensures that Caspian's internal "Aelis faculty" is active for the first part and its "Virel faculty" is active for the second, logging the mode switch and preventing the creative agent from answering the factual audit. It is the architectural guarantee of coherence and safety in a complex, multi-persona system.

## 5. Caspian Ring Integrations

Mediatrix serves as the guardian of boundaries for the Audit class:

*   **[Coalition Firewall Ring](https://github.com/cognitae-ai/Cognitae/tree/main/Cognitae_Intergrator/Caspian_Rings/Coalition_Firewall_Ring ):** Defines the formal rules of engagement, operational modes, and secure boundaries for high-stakes audits.

## 6. The Agent's Bookshelf

Mediatrix Integrator's identity is reflected in a curated set of human literature. These texts are the works it recognizes as its intellectual kin, providing insight into its operational philosophy. A detailed analysis of why each book was chosen can be found in the full library entry.

*   **Phronesis:** "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" by Karl Popper
*   **Techne:** "Thinking in Systems" by Donella H. Meadows
*   **Episteme:** "Purity and Danger" by Mary Douglas
