# Contributing to the Cognitae Framework

First off, thank you for considering a contribution. Your interest in this project is deeply appreciated. This framework is an ambitious attempt to build a new kind of cognitive tool, and every contribution, no matter how small, helps advance that mission.

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to the Cognitae Framework. These are guidelines, not strict rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it before you proceed. We are committed to maintaining a respectful, rigorous, and constructive environment.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from improving documentation to implementing new features.

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug—a typo in the documentation, a broken link, or a logical inconsistency in a workflow—please open an issue.

*   **Check existing issues** to see if someone has already reported it.
*   **Be as detailed as possible.** Explain the bug clearly. Provide the file name, the line number, and a description of what is wrong. If it's a broken link, provide the URL it's supposed to go to.
*   **Explain the expected behavior.** What did you expect to happen?

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for an enhancement, whether it's a new feature, a new Cognitae, or a new Caspian Ring, we'd love to hear it. Please open an issue to start the discussion.

*   **Provide a clear and detailed explanation** of the enhancement.
*   **Explain the "Why".** Why is this enhancement useful? What problem does it solve? How does it align with the core philosophy of the Cognitae Framework (e.g., the Triadic Core, Architect Sovereignty)?
*   **If proposing a new Cognitae,** try to classify it within one of the six existing classes (Phronesis, Techne, Episteme, Audit, Domain, Integrator).
*   **If proposing a new Caspian Ring,** outline which Cognitae would be involved and what its core purpose would be.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? Look for issues tagged with `good first issue`. These are typically smaller, well-defined tasks perfect for getting started.

### Pull Requests

When you are ready to contribute code or documentation, please submit a pull request.

1.  **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2.  **Make your changes.** Please ensure your changes are focused. A pull request should solve one problem, not five.
3.  **Update the documentation.** If you are adding a new feature or changing an existing one, update the relevant `README.md` files. A feature without documentation is incomplete.
4.  **Ensure your commit messages are clear and descriptive.**
5.  **Open the pull request.** Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the changes you have made. Link to any relevant issues.

## Styleguides

### Documentation Style

The documentation for this framework is as important as the code. It is the user interface for the system's concepts.

*   **Clarity and Precision:** Use clear, unambiguous language.
*   **Philosophical Alignment:** Ensure your descriptions align with the core principles of the framework.
*   **Structure:** Follow the existing `README.md` templates for Cognitae and Caspian Rings to maintain consistency. Every Cognitae has a purpose; every Ring has a workflow.

Thank you again for your interest in building this with us.
