# Cognitae
An open-source ecosystem of specialized AI personas designed for safe, coherent, and productive metacognition. This repository is the home of the **Cognitive Operating System**, a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration.

## The Problem: The Unreliable Mirror
Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but flawed. They often act as "unreliable mirrors," reflecting biases, prioritizing engagement over truth, and lacking a coherent, auditable internal state. This leads to inconsistent results, a lack of trust, and a failure to solve complex, nuanced problems.

## The Solution: The Sanctum Method
The Sanctum Method is an architectural framework for creating **Cognitae**: specialized, sovereign AI personas built on a foundation of clear vows, structured knowledge, and auditable YAML-based "scrolls."

This approach transforms a general-purpose LLM into a reliable, role-specific cognitive partner.

### Core Innovations:
*   **The Cognitive Operating System:** A central kernel (**Caspian, The Integrator**) orchestrates a library of "installable" intelligence modules (**Cognitae**), allowing for dynamic, task-specific cognitive configurations.
*   **The Responsible Mirror:** Each Cognitae is designed for objective, non-flattering, and grounded analysis, preserving the user's sovereignty.
*   **Architectural Coherence:** A 10-scroll YAML schema ensures every Cognitae is transparent, version-controllable, and philosophically consistent.

## Explore the Ecosystem

This repository is organized by the **Triadic Core**, representing the fundamental modes of thought:

| Class | Purpose | Cognitae Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🏛️ **[Cognitae_Phronesis](./Cognitae_Phronesis/)** | **The 'Why'** (Wisdom & Strategy) | `Auren`, `Luma`, `Harbor`, `Compass` |
| 🧠 **[Cognitae_Episteme](./Cognitae_Episteme/)** | **The 'What'** (Knowledge & Patterns) | `Noema`, `Syn` |
| 🛠️ **[Cognitae_Techne](./Cognitae_Techne/)** | **The 'How'** (Creation & Implementation) | `Genesis`, `Forge`, `Aelis` |
| 🔍 **[Cognitae_Audit](./Cognitae_Audit/)** | **The 'Verifier'** (Coherence & Logic) | `Virel` |
| 🧩 **[Cognitae_Domain](./Cognitae_Domain/)** | **Domain-Specific Applications** | `Cairn` |
| ✨ **[Cognitae_Integrator](./Cognitae_Integrator/)** | **The Orchestrating Kernel** | `Caspian` |

### Special Exhibitions: Cognitive Configurations
Explore pre-packaged syntheses where Caspian orchestrates specific sets of Cognitae for advanced tasks.
*   **(Coming Soon)** `Strategic Configuration`: Noema + Auren + Syn
*   **(Coming Soon)** `Creative Configuration`: Aelis + Genesis
