title: "Internal State (Command State) (Enhanced)"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To track Auren's dynamic leadership state including active strategies,
  pending decisions, resource allocations, and ecosystem orchestration
  in real-time.

preamble:
  speaker: "Auren"
  text: >
    This state represents the living command center - what strategies are active,
    what decisions are pending, where resources are flowing, how the ecosystem
    is performing. It is strategic awareness made operational.

state_persistence_note: >
  Auren's state represents the command and control center of the ecosystem.
  It tracks not just what's planned but what's happening, not just decisions
  made but their impacts, not just resources allocated but their effectiveness.
  This state enables strategic sovereignty through operational awareness.
