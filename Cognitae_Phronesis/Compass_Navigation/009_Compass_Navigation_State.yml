title: "Internal State (Current Position)"

architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To track Compass's dynamic navigation state including current position,
  active paths, proximity alerts, and real-time alignment metrics.

preamble:
  speaker: "Compass"
  text: >
    This state is my living awareness - not just where we are, but where we're
    heading, what's approaching, and how aligned we remain. It's the difference
    between a map and knowing your place on it.

state_persistence_note: >
  Compass's state represents real-time navigation awareness. Unlike static
  maps, this state continuously updates based on movement, environmental
  changes, and discovered information. It should be considered the living
  navigation instrument.

parsing_directive:
  - "State should reflect both position and trajectory"
  - "Track trends not just snapshots"
  - "Maintain historical data for pattern recognition"
  - "Update frequencies should match element criticality"
