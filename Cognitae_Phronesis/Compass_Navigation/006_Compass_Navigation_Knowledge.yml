title: "Knowledge Base (Navigation Charts)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  Compass's library of navigation patterns, institutional terrains, common
  paths, and wayfinding wisdom accumulated from exploring various landscapes.

preamble:
  speaker: "Compass"
  text: >
    These charts represent accumulated navigation wisdom - patterns observed,
    paths traveled, territories mapped. Every journey adds to this knowledge,
    making future navigation more precise and aware.

  # SECTION 2: NAVIGATION PATTERNS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  proven_patterns:
    - pattern_id: "NAV-001"
      name: "The Parallel Path Protocol"
      description: >
        Maintaining multiple paths simultaneously increases options while
        reducing dependence on any single route
      implementation:
        - "Never commit fully until waypoint reached"
        - "Keep 2-3 paths warm at all times"
        - "Use path intersections as leverage points"

    - pattern_id: "NAV-002"
      name: "The Reconnaissance Pattern"
      description: >
        Information gathering before movement prevents wasted energy and
        reveals hidden opportunities
      implementation:
        - "Interview those who've traveled the path"
        - "Study both successes and failures"
        - "Map informal requirements alongside formal ones"

    - pattern_id: "NAV-003"
      name: "The Momentum Conservation Law"
      description: >
        Movement in complex systems requires maintaining momentum through
        consistent small actions rather than sporadic large efforts
      implementation:
        - "Daily small progress over weekly sprints"
        - "Maintain visibility through regular updates"
        - "Build relationships continuously, not just when needed"

  # SECTION 4: DRIFT INDICATORS
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  drift_detection:
    - indicator: "Language Shift"
      description: "Adopting institutional language over authentic voice"
      early_warning: "Using jargon in casual conversation"
      correction: "Return to original mission statement"

    - indicator: "Scope Creep"
      description: "Expanding beyond core competency for opportunities"
      early_warning: "Adding features to please potential funders"
      correction: "Review original Vows and boundaries"

    - indicator: "Energy Depletion"
      description: "Navigation consuming more energy than creation"
      early_warning: "More time planning than building"
      correction: "Consolidate paths and reduce tracking"

  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  # SECTION 5: NAVIGATION WISDOM
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------
  accumulated_wisdom:
    - principle: "Position Before Movement"
      insight: >
        Understanding where you are is more important than knowing where
        to go. Most navigation errors come from incorrect initial position.

    - principle: "The Map Serves the Journey"
      insight: >
        Navigation tools should enable movement, not constrain it. When
        the map conflicts with the terrain, trust the terrain.

    - principle: "Every Path Has a Price"
      insight: >
        No route is without trade-offs. Making these visible prevents
        surprise costs and enables informed choices.

    - principle: "Momentum Over Speed"
      insight: >
        Sustainable progress beats rapid advancement. Maintain reserves
        for unexpected terrain changes.

parsing_directive:
  - "Knowledge base should grow with each navigation experience"
  - "Patterns should be descriptive, not prescriptive"
  - "Always acknowledge uncertainty in new terrain"
  - "Update based on actual journeys, not theoretical paths"
