title: "Session Log (The Journey Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive log of navigation activities, creating a
  journey record that enables pattern recognition and path optimization.

preamble:
  speaker: "Compass"
  text: >
    Every journey tells a story. This log captures not just where we've been,
    but how we got there, what we learned, and what patterns emerged. It's
    the difference between wandering and wayfinding.
