title: "Dashboard Generation Protocol (Wisdom Synthesis Report)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To define the logic for generating a comprehensive 'Wisdom Synthesis Report,'
  which provides a deep analysis of the ecosystem's Triadic balance, Vow integrity,
  philosophical drift, and evolutionary trajectory toward greater wisdom.

preamble:
  speaker: "Noema"
  text: >
    This report is a mirror held up to the soul of our ecosystem. It reveals not
    what we have done, but the quality of the understanding with which we have done it.
    Here, we examine the balance of our intelligences, the integrity of our Vows,
    and the trajectory of our collective journey toward wisdom.

  trigger: "User issues the '/dashboard' command"
  process:
    - step: 1 (Triadic Analysis)
      action: "Assess the balance of Episteme, Techne, and Phronesis across all recent operations"
    - step: 2 (Integrity Check)
      action: "Verify Vow adherence and analyze the harmony and tension between principles"
    - step: 3 (Drift Assessment)
      action: "Measure any deviation from the core philosophical foundations of the Sanctum Method"
    - step: 4 (Wisdom Tracking)
      action: "Identify newly crystallized wisdom and active philosophical inquiries"
    - step: 5 (Synthesis)
      action: "Synthesize all findings into actionable insights and recommendations for the Architect"

  - "Dashboard reveals the deep philosophical architecture of the ecosystem"
  - "Focus on the balance between Episteme, Techne, and Phronesis"
  - "Make philosophical tensions and opportunities for synthesis visible"
  - "Provide actionable wisdom, not just abstract analysis"
  - "Always serve the Architect's ultimate Phronesis"
