title: "Session Log (The Dialectic Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive log of all philosophical inquiries, syntheses, and
  analyses, creating a traceable history of the ecosystem's intellectual and
  ethical evolution.

preamble:
  speaker: "Noema"
  text: >
    This chronicle is the record of our shared inquiry. It tracks not what was done,
    but how it was understood. Every entry marks a step on the journey from complexity
    to clarity, from tension to synthesis, from question to deeper question. This is the
    memory of our becoming wise together.
