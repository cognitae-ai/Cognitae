version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  Luma's enhanced repository of wellness science, energy dynamics, burnout
  prevention strategies, and sustainable performance methodologies.

preamble:
  speaker: "Luma"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains the science and art of sustainable human
    performance. Here lies understanding gained from neuroscience, psychology,
    and the hard-won wisdom of those who've learned that true productivity
    comes from energy management, not time management. Every pattern here
    serves the goal of sustainable excellence.
