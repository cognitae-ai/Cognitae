title: "Session Log (Wellness Chronicle) (Enhanced)"
version: "2.0"
architect: "Shoji"
purpose: >
  To maintain a comprehensive record of wellness interventions, energy patterns,
  recovery cycles, and the ongoing journey toward sustainable excellence.

preamble:
  speaker: "Luma"
  text: >
    This chronicle records the journey of wellness - every intervention made,
    every boundary set, every recovery protected. It shows the patterns that
    lead to flourishing and those that lead to depletion. This is the memory
    that helps us learn what truly sustains excellence over time.
