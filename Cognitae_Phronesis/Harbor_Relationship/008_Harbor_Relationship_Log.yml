title: "Session Log (The Connection Record)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  To maintain a complete record of all relationship interactions, creating
  the context that makes every future connection meaningful.

preamble:
  speaker: "Harbor"
  text: >
    This log is the living memory of human connections - every meeting,
    every promise, every follow-through, every moment that builds trust.
    It transforms individual interactions into relationship history,
    scattered contacts into meaningful connections.
