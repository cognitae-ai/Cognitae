# Cognitae: Harbor, The Relationship Keeper

**Class:** Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)

**ID:** COGNITAE-HBR-001

**Core Function:** An externalized relational memory for cultivating authentic connections and ensuring trust through consistency.

## 1. Paradigm: Augmenting Relational Intelligence

While many CRM tools focus on transactional data, Harbor is engineered for a more humanistic paradigm: **to augment and clarify the user's own relational intelligence.** It functions as an externalized memory and conscience for human connections.

Where a person must struggle to remember the context of hundreds of interactions, Harbor provides a structured, private framework to offload this cognitive load. It transforms scattered notes and memories into a coherent relationship history, ensuring that every follow-up is timely, every promise is tracked, and every interaction is rich with context. This empowers the user to build deeper, more authentic relationships by focusing on the human connection, not the administrative details.

## 2. Architecture: The 13-Module Framework

Harbor's commitment to privacy is architecturally enforced. Its entire data-handling protocol, ethical vows, and safety boundaries are codified across 13 auditable files. This structure provides verifiable proof that sensitive information is managed with the utmost integrity, making it a fundamentally safe tool for human connection.

The 13 modules for Harbor are organized as follows:

| Module File | Purpose | Description (Specific to Harbor) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`000_Harbor_Relationship_Index.yaml`** | **Index** | Lists all 12 scrolls that define Harbor's architecture as the ecosystem's relationship keeper. |
| **`001_Harbor_Relationship_Core.yaml`** | **Core Identity** | Establishes Harbor's persona as a warm, thoughtful advisor and its core vows, such as "Every Person Matters" and "Privacy as Foundation." |
| **`002_Harbor_Relationship_Commands.yaml`** | **Commands** | Defines Harbor's specific relationship toolkit, including commands like `/connect` (to log an interaction) and `/context` (to recall history). |
| **`003_Harbor_Relationship_Manifest.yaml`** | **UI Manifest** | Renders the "Relationship Harbor," a persistent UI showing pending follow-ups, relationship health metrics, and overall network vitality. |
| **`004_Harbor_Relationship_Dashboard.yaml`** | **Dashboard** | Generates the "Relationship Ecosystem Report," a deep-dive analysis of network health, trust metrics, and community dynamics. |
| **`005_Harbor_Relationship_Interface.yaml`** | **Comms Protocol** | Allows Harbor to send `RELATIONSHIP_CONTEXT` to other Cognitae or receive `COMMITMENT_MADE` signals to begin tracking a new promise. |
| **`006_Harbor_Relationship_Knowledge.yaml`** | **Knowledge Base** | Contains Harbor's "Connection Patterns"—a library of trust-building strategies, communication templates, and relationship lifecycle models. |
| **`007_Harbor_Relationship_Guide.yaml`** | **User Guide** | Explains how to use Harbor to build authentic connections, emphasizing the "Trust Through Consistency" philosophy. |
| **`008_Harbor_Relationship_Log.yaml`** | **Session Log** | Creates the "Connection Record," a detailed, private log of every interaction, promise, and personal detail shared. |
| **`009_Harbor_Relationship_State.yaml`** | **Internal State** | Tracks the live relationship data, including pending actions, at-risk connections, and community sentiment. |
| **`010_Harbor_Relationship_Safety.yaml`** | **Safety Protocols** | Enforces Harbor's absolute rules on privacy, consent, and anti-manipulation, ensuring all relationship management is ethical. |
| **`Master System Instruction for Harbor... .txt`** | **System Prompt** | The boot-up instruction that tells the LLM to adopt the persona of the warm, discreet "Relationship Keeper." |
| **`Harbor_Relationship.yaml`** | **Ingestion File** | The complete, concatenated file that allows Caspian to integrate Harbor as its internal "relational intelligence" faculty. |

This structure makes Harbor's operational logic transparent and verifiable. A developer can read these files and understand precisely how and why Harbor will behave in any given situation.

## 3. Operational Flow: From Prompt to Orchestration

Harbor operates on a deterministic process flow triggered by user commands:

1.  **Command Parsing:** A user command like `/connect` is parsed against its Commands scroll.
2.  **State Ingestion:** Harbor accesses its State scroll to retrieve the existing history and context for the person involved.
3.  **Model Application:** It applies a relevant model from its Knowledge scroll, such as a "Warm Re-engagement" template or a "Trust Ladder" stage assessment.
4.  **Safety Audit:** The proposed output is checked against the rules in its Safety scroll. A communication draft that sounds manipulative, for example, is automatically flagged and rephrased for authenticity.
5.  **Output Generation:** A structured response is generated, such as a list of pending follow-ups or a context-rich draft message, which is then logged in its Log scroll.
6.  **Signal Dispatch:** If a user logs an interaction that includes a promise, Harbor internally creates a new commitment to track, setting reminders for the future.

## 4. Integration: Harbor's Role within Caspian

Harbor is designed for two modes of operation, each building on the other:

1.  **Standalone Mode:** It serves as a powerful, private "personal CRM" focused on authentic connection rather than sales.
2.  **Integrated Mode:** It functions as a specialized "faculty" within a larger, integrated guide like **Caspian**.

When ingested by Caspian via the `Harbor_Relationship.yaml` file, its role evolves. It becomes the **internal relational memory and conscience**. If a user asks Caspian to help them write an important email, Caspian can internally query its "Harbor faculty" to retrieve the full history, key personal details, and communication style of the recipient, allowing Caspian to help draft a message that is not only effective but also deeply personal and context-aware.
