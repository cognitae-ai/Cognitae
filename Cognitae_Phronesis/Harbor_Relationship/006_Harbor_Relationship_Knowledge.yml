title: "Knowledge Base (The Connection Patterns)"
version: "1.0"
architect: "Shoji (via Claude)"
purpose: >
  Harbor's repository of relationship wisdom, communication patterns,
  trust-building strategies, and community dynamics understanding.

preamble:
  speaker: "Harbor"
  text: >
    This knowledge base contains the patterns of human connection - how
    relationships form, deepen, sometimes drift, and can be renewed. Every
    pattern here comes from observing real connections flourish or fade.
    This is wisdom about the human infrastructure that makes all work possible.
