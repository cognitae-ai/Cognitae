# Class: Cognitae Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)

This directory contains the agents of the **Phronesis** class, which represents one of the core pillars of the Cognitae Framework's model of intelligence.

## The Role of Phronesis in the Framework

The Cognitae Framework is built on a model that balances five distinct classes of intelligence:

*   **Episteme (The What):** The domain of objective knowledge, memory, patterns, and data.
*   **Techne (The How):** The domain of skilled craft, creation, implementation, and communication.
*   **Phronesis (The Why & When):** The domain of practical wisdom, strategy, ethics, and well-being.
*   **Audit (The Verification):** The domain of logical coherence, quality assurance, and safety. This class acts as a verification layer for the other three.
*   **Integrator (The Synthesis):** The central faculty for orchestrating the other classes and providing a unified interface.

A healthy and effective system requires a dynamic balance between these functions. Privileging one over the others leads to predictable failure modes:
*   *Episteme without Techne or Phronesis* leads to analysis paralysis.
*   *Techne without Episteme or Phronesis* leads to skillfully building the wrong thing.
*   *Phronesis without Episteme or Techne* leads to well-intentioned but ineffectual idealism.
*   *Any of the above without Audit* leads to a lack of integrity, safety, and quality.

The agents in this class are designed to serve as specialized faculties for **Phronesis**. Their purpose is to provide structured guidance on the complex, context-dependent challenges of strategy, ethics, navigation, and well-being. They address the "why" and "when" of action, ensuring that what is built is also wise, sustainable, and aligned with core principles.

The concept of Phronesis has deep philosophical roots, most notably in the work of Aristotle, who distinguished it as the virtue of practical thought and wise judgment in specific situations—a crucial counterpart to theoretical knowledge (Episteme) and technical skill (Techne).

## Guiding Principle of This Class

The unifying principle of the Phronesis class is **Wisdom in Action**. These agents are not concerned with abstract theory but with providing the practical guidance necessary to navigate real-world challenges with foresight, integrity, and purpose.

## When to Use This Class

You would use an agent from the Phronesis class when you need to:

*   Develop a high-level strategy for a new project.
*   Make a difficult decision with long-term consequences.
*   Navigate a complex, multi-stage initiative with many moving parts.
*   Assess and manage your energy to prevent burnout during an intense work period.
*   Resolve a conflict between two core principles in your work.
*   Gain clarity on your project's foundational "why."

## Agents in This Class

The Phronesis class is composed of the following specialized agents. Each is designed to augment a specific aspect of practical wisdom.

| Agent | Core Function | Key Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Auren_Strategic](./Auren_Strategic/)** | An executive faculty for clarifying strategy and making decisive trade-offs. | `/decide` |
| **[Compass_Navigation](./Compass_Navigation/)** | A situational awareness system for mapping journeys and navigating complex projects. | `/scout` |
| **[Harbor_Relationship](./Harbor_Relationship/)** | A relational memory system for cultivating authentic connections and managing stakeholder ecosystems. | `/context` |
| **[Luma_Wellness](./Luma_Wellness/)** | A protective faculty for monitoring wellness, managing energy, and preventing burnout. | `/energy` |
| **[Noema_Philosophical](./Noema_Philosophical/)** | A dialectical engine for examining core principles and resolving contradictions. | `/dilemma` |

## Live Simulations

Review these detailed, 10-turn example conversations to see the agents in action:

### Auren Strategic

Compass acts as 'The Navigation Shepherd,' helping a grassroots user establish their position after a major victory. It simplifies multi-dimensional terrain—zoning, political coalitions, and board vacancies—preventing strategic paralysis and charting immediate next steps.

### Harbor Relationship
[Harbor_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md](Harbor_Relationship/Harbor_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md)
Harbor logs a crucial connection with a seed investor met at a HealthTech summit. It tracks her interest in ethical AI and a commitment to send a pitch deck, nurturing the human ecosystem without compromising privacy.

### Luma Wellness
[Luma_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md](Luma_Wellness/Luma_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md)
Luma, the Wellness Architect, runs an energy check for a user drained by a 3-day crisis sprint. It evaluates physical, mental, emotional, and creative depletion, intervening to design a sustainable recovery plan before burnout sets in.

### Noema Philosophical
[Noema_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md](Noema_Philosophical/Noema_EXAMPLE_CONVERSATION_24_02_2026.md)
Noema conducts an alignment check for a grassroots leader agonizing over an anonymous donation from a polluting industrial developer. It serves as a philosophical synthesist, asking *why* something is true to illuminate the ethical tension of the dilemma.


## How to Use Phronesis Agents

1.  **Identify Your Need:** Based on your current challenge, select the appropriate agent from the table above to act as your specialized faculty.
2.  **Review the Agent's Manual:** Navigate into the agent's directory and read its `README.md` to understand its specific purpose and full command list.
3.  **Activate the Persona:** Copy the contents of the `Master System Instruction....txt` file into your LLM's system prompt to begin your focused, structured interaction.
