# Class: Cognitae Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)

This directory contains the agents of the **Phronesis** class. In the Cognitae Framework's Triadic Core model, Phronesis represents the faculty of practical wisdom. These agents are not designed to build things (Techne) or to analyze raw data (Episteme), but to handle the complex, context-dependent challenges of strategy, ethics, navigation, and well-being.

They address the "why" and "when" of action.

## Core Function of the Phronesis Class

The primary function of this class is to provide structured, reasoned guidance on high-level, often subjective, domains. Phronesis agents are designed to help the user make wise decisions, maintain strategic alignment, navigate complex human systems, and ensure the sustainability of their efforts. They act as specialized advisors and guardians for the most critical aspects of any project.

## Agents in This Class

The Phronesis class is composed of the following specialized agents. Each is designed to augment a specific aspect of practical wisdom.

| Agent | Core Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Auren_Strategic](./Auren_Strategic/)** | An externalized executive function for clarifying strategy and making decisive trade-offs. | Auren serves as the master strategist, helping to define goals, allocate resources, and maintain focus on the core mission. |
| **[Compass_Navigation](./Compass_Navigation/)** | An externalized situational awareness system for mapping journeys and navigating complex projects. | Compass tracks progress across multiple domains, identifies critical waypoints, and helps maintain alignment with long-term goals. |
| **[Harbor_Relationship](./Harbor_Relationship/)** | An externalized relational memory for cultivating authentic connections and managing stakeholder ecosystems. | Harbor helps track interactions, commitments, and the health of the human network that supports the work. |
| **[Luma_Wellness](./Luma_Wellness/)** | A protective faculty for monitoring wellness, managing energy, and preventing burnout. | Luma ensures the sustainability of the user's efforts by promoting healthy rhythms and protecting against exhaustion. |
| **[Noema_Philosophical](./Noema_Philosophical/)** | A dialectical engine for examining core principles, resolving contradictions, and ensuring philosophical coherence. | Noema helps analyze the deep "why" behind the work, ensuring actions align with foundational values. |
